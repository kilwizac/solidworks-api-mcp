  "remarks": "The behavior for this option depends on the boundaries.\nWhen all the boundaries belong to the same solid body, you can use the surface fill to patch the solid.\nIf at least one of the edges is an open sheet edge and you merge results, then the fill knits with the surfaces to which the edges belong. See\nIFillSurfaceFeatureData::Merge\nfor details about merging results.\nIf all the boundary entities are open edges, then a solid may be created.\nSee\nIFillSurfaceFeatureData::GetPatchBoundary\nor\nIFillSurfaceFeatureData::IGetPatchBoundary\nand\nIFillSurfaceFeatureData::SetPatchBoundary\nor\nIFillSurfaceFeatureData::ISetPatchBoundary\nfor details about boundary entities.",
