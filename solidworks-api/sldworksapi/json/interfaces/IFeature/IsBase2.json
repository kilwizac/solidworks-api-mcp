  "remarks": "Any feature that creates a solid body is a base feature. For example:\nAn extrude operation creates a solid body; therefore, that feature is a base feature.\nA body imported via an IGES file is a base feature.\nHowever, a fillet operation does not create a solid body; therefore, that feature is not a base feature.\nIn a multibody environment, more than one feature can return true. Thus, a lot of features can be base features in a multibody environment.",
