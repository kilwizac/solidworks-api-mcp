Set the feature data object to null when it is no longer needed. Not all feature types are supported, so check to see that the returned object is valid.\nTo:\nget the type of feature and the name of its associated interface, use\nIFeature::GetTypeName\nor\nIFeature::GetTypeName2\n.\nsee a complete list of interfaces for feature data objects (e.g., interfaces ending in FeatureData or FeatureData2, such as IExtrudeFeatureData2, ILoftFeatureData, ISimpleFilletFeatureData2, IChamferFeatureData2, etc.), see the\nFeatures Interfaces\nsection in\nFunctional Categories\n.\nget the object of a feature that is not a feature data object, use\nIFeature::GetSpecificFeature2\n.",
