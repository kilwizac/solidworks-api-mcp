  "remarks": "You must create the replacement body as an imported body using\nIBody2::CreateBodyFromSurfaces\nor\nIBody2::ICreateTempBodyFromSurfaces\n, as a copy of an imported body generated by these methods, or using translation from IGES in, STEP in, and so on.\nIf this feature is not the base feature or the body is not an imported body, then the method returns false.\nThis method replaces the base body or ref-surface body if you created either of these features from imported geometry. If child features exist, then you can use\nIFace2::GetFaceId\nto set the face IDs to both the old body and the replacement body before calling IFeature::ISetBody3. For example, if you are expecting a child feature on a face of the old body to be mapped to a face on the replacement body, you need to set the same ID (integer) to these two faces. This mechanism enables child features to re-attach themselves to the replacement body because IFeature::ISetBody3 cannot do this automatically.\nIf applyUserIds...\nThen Feature::ISetBody3...\nTrue\nTries to match the face IDs on the replacement body with IDs on the child features. This helps when re-attaching the features to the replacement body.\nfalse\nReplaces the original body with the replacement body. Face IDs are not be used to match up new faces with child features.",
