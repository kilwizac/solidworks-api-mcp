  "remarks": "This method does not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running. Use\nIModelDoc2::DeSelectByID\ninstead of using this method. IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID handles selection correctly whether or not a command is running.\nTo select or deselect a sketch segment, the owning document of that ISketchSegment object needs to be open and visible.\nISketchSegment selections are accessible through the\nISelectionMgr\nof the owning document of the sketch segment object, even if the owning document is not active.\nSelection or deselection does not work for a sketch segment in a document within a drawing. Selection or deselection of sketch segments owned by the drawing does work, but only if the drawing document is active.\nIf the owning sketch of a sketch segment was active, or inactive, when the sketch segment was obtained, then it must be active, or inactive, to deselect it. For example, if the owning sketch of a sketch segment was active when the sketch segment was obtained, then the owning sketch must be active to select or deselect the sketch segment. Likewise, if the owning sketch of a sketch segment was inactive when the sketch segment was obtained, then the owning sketch must be inactive to select or deselect the sketch segment.",
