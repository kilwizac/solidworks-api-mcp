  "remarks": "The purpose of this method is to support recording macros. You should use\nIComponent2::GetSuppression\nor\nIComponent2::SetSuppression2\nto get or set a component to lightweight.\nThis method sets the current selected components to lightweight, which is suitable for recording and running macros. IComponent2::GetSuppression and IComponent2::SetSuppression2 operate on the component itself.",
