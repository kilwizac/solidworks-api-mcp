  "remarks": "Transforms contains an array of [Count x 16] doubles. This parameter stores one transformation matrix of 16 doubles for each component in Names. If a component's transformation matrix is null, then the component is placed in the assembly such that the component's user-defined coordinate system coincides exactly with the default coordinate system of the assembly (no transformation). See\nIMathTransform\nfor details about transformation matrices.\nCoordinateSystemNames contains a user-defined coordinate system name for each component in Names. If a component's user-defined coordinate system is an empty string, then the component is placed in the assembly with respect to the default coordinate system of the component.\nThe application must allocate the array of components, and it is also responsible for releasing the returned array of components.",
