  "remarks": "If no assembly feature is selected, this method removes a component from the list that is to be used with the next assembly feature created.\nAssembly features allow you to create a feature that affects multiple components in an assembly. For example, if you need a hole through two blocks to bolt them together, you can create a hole as an assembly feature and make it go through both blocks.\nThe scope of the assembly feature determines which components are affected by this feature. In other words, it describes which components can contain the feature.\nThere are two ways to use the this technique:\nIf you have an assembly feature selected, this method removes a component from the assembly features scope. Any component that is not in the scope of the assembly feature cannot be affected by the assembly feature.\nIf you create a list of components, this method allows you to remove a component from the list. The next assembly feature created affects each of the components in your list.\nAfter you use one of these techniques, you can use\nIAssemblyDoc::UpdateFeatureScope\nto display the changes.",
