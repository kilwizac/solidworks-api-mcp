  "remarks": "If no assembly feature is selected, then this method adds a component to a list for use with the next assembly feature created.\nAssembly features allow you to create a feature that affects multiple components in an assembly. For example, if you need a hole through two blocks so that you could bolt them together, you can create a hole as an assembly feature and make it go through both blocks.\nThe scope of the assembly feature determines which components are effected by this feature. In other words, it describes which components can contain the feature.\nThere are two ways to use the IAssemblyDoc::AddToFeatureScope method:\nWhen an assembly feature is selected, IAssemblyDoc::AddToFeatureScope adds a component to the assembly feature's scope. Any component in the scope of the assembly feature can be affected by the assembly feature.\nYou can also use IAssemblyDoc::AddToFeatureScope to compile a group of components. The next assembly feature created (for example,\nIFeatureManager::SimpleHole\n) affects each of the components in the compiled group.\nAfter completing these steps, use\nIAssemblyDoc::UpdateFeatureScope\nto display the changes.",
