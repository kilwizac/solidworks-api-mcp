  "remarks": "Selection of guide curves and centerline is optional. However, you must select the profiles in an order consistent with the desired direction of the loft. Because a solid is being created, the section profiles must be closed.\nIt is best to use guide curves, especially when you select profiles in the FeatureManager design tree.\nYou can use any number of profiles; however, if you select only one profile, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves.\nUse\nIModelDocExtension::SelectByID2\nto select the profiles and guide curves. Set the mark for:\nprofile selections to 1\nany guide curve selection to 2\ncenterline selection to 4\nstart tangency vector selection to 8\nstart tangency faces selection to 16 (not available)\nend tangency vector selection to 32\nend tangency faces selection to 64 (not available)\nNOTE:\nLinear edge, sketch line, axis, plane and planar faces are qualified for tangency vector sections.\nWhen UseAutoSelect is false, the user must select the bodies that the feature will affect.",
