  "remarks": "This method gets all of the table annotations of a split table. Many of the\nITableAnnotation\nmethods and properties get table annotation information that is common to all table annotations. You should apply these\nITableAnnotation\nmethods and properties to only one of the split table annotations returned by this method. Otherwise, you will get redundant data.\nFor example, if you change the thickness of the grid line, then changing it on one table annotation affects all splits of that table annotation. Thus, for this method, you might want to specify 1 for Count so that a single value is returned. Or, you can call\nIPunchTable::GetTableAnnotationCount\nif you want the total number of table annotations, including any splits, for this punch table feature.",
