  "remarks": "This method provides the ability to place your newly created Feature Manager tab on either the top or bottom pane. The pane may or may not be visible. However, the tab is added to the specified pane.\nUnder certain conditions, for example while the\nSurface, Extend\ncommand is active in the user interface, SOLIDWORKS locks the bottom pane and does not allow the activation of any other tab. If your application needs the ability to activate your new tab at all times, consider adding it either to the top pane or to both panes. If you add it to the top pane only, it may not be apparent to the user until the top pane is made visible.\nIf you receive a non-NULL return value, you can use\nIFeatMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWnd\nor\nIFeatureMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWndx64\nto get the new view handle. Because the view created is empty, you can use the new view handle in combination with standard MFC calls to draw, as desired, into the view.\nThe FeatureManager design tree view added to this document is not persistent. In other words, the FeatureManager design tree view is not stored with this document and must be recreated upon reloading the document.\nThis method automatically sets up to receive FeatMgrView\nActivateNotify\nand\nDeactivateNotify\nevents. On the appropriate notification, you can call\nIModelDoc2::DeleteFeatureMgrView\nor\nIModelDocExtension::DeleteFeatureMgrViewx64\nto clean up and delete your view.",
