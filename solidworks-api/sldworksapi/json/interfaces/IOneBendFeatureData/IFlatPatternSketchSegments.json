  "remarks": "Before calling this method, call\nIOneBendFeatureData::GetFlatPatternSketchSegmentCount\nto populate SegmentsCount.\nThe sketch segments are calculated in the flattened model. Before calling this method, flatten the model either by un-suppressing the flat pattern in the FeatureManager design tree or by calling\nIModelDoc2::SetBendState\nto set BendState to\nswSMBendState_e\n.swSMBendStateFlattened.\nSee\nAccessing Selections that Define Features\nfor additional details on using this method.",
