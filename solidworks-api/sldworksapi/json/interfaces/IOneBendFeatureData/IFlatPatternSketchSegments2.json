  "remarks": "Before calling this method, call\nIOneBendFeatureData::GetFlatPatternSketchSegmentCount2\nto populate SegmentsCount.\nThe sketch segments are calculated in the flattened model. Before calling this method, flatten the model either by unsuppressing the flat pattern in the FeatureManager design tree or by calling\nIModelDoc2::SetBendState\nto set BendState to\nswSMBendState_e\n.swSMBendStateFlattened.\nThis property returns the bend lines for older parts that do not have flat patterns.\nSee\nAccessing Selections that Define Features\nfor additional details on using this method.",
