  "remarks": "The leader style of an arc length dimension is specific to each display dimension. The leader style can be parallel (the leaders are parallel to each other) or radial (the leaders are perpendicular to the extension line and would extend through the center of the arc). The style can be selected automatically by SOLIDWORKS, or specified by the user.\nIf the autoLeader value is passed in as True to automatically select the leader style, then SOLIDWORKS ignores the leaderStyle value.\nThis method applies only to arc length dimensions. It does not affect any other types of dimensions.\nAfter using this method, use\nIModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2\nto redraw the graphics window to see your changes.",
