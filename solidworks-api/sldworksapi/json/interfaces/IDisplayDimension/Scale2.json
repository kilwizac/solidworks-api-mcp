  "description": "Gets or sets the scale value that is applied to the dimension value of this non-associative distance dimension.",
  "signature": "System.Double Scale2 {get; set;}",
  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "Scale applied to the dimension value",
  "remarks": "This scale value applies only to non-associative distance dimensions, such as those created using\nIDrawingDoc::CreateLinearDim4\nor\nIDrawingDoc::CreateDiamDim4\n. For these dimensions, SOLIDWORKS multiplies the actual dimension measurement by this scale value to get the dimension value that is displayed on the screen. For any other types of dimensions (such as associative dimensions or angular measurement dimensions), setting the scale factor has no effect and getting the scale factor will always return 1.\nThe scale value must be greater than 0. This has no effect in the OLE interface, and returns S_false in the COM interface.\nAfter using this property, use\nIModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2\nto redraw the graphics window to see your changes.",
