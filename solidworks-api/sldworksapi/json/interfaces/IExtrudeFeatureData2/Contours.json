  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "Array of contours (see Remarks )",
  "remarks": "The array passed to or returned by this property can contain both\nISketchContour\nand\nISketchRegion\nobjects. This method returns an emtpy array if sketch contours or sketch regions do not exist.\nNOTE:\nAn extrude feature has one, and only one, sketch. If the sketch does not contain sketch contours or sketch regions, then an empty array is returned. To get the sketch of an extrude feature that does not contain sketch contours or sketch regions, you can traverse the FeatureManager design tree to get the parent sketch of the extrude feature.\nSee\nAccessing Selections that Define Features\nfor additional details on using this property.",
