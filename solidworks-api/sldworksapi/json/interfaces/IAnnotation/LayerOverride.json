  "remarks": "Layers are currently supported only in SOLIDWORKS drawings.\nYou should set this property only when you want to reset specific visual properties to the default visual properties of the owning layer. If you want to change or set specific values for the visual property of this item, use\nIAnnotation::Color\n,\nIAnnotation::Style\n, and\nIAnnotation::Width\n.\nIn drawing documents, annotations can be created on a layer that has specific visual properties. By default, the annotation takes on the visual properties defined by the layer. However, for a specific annotation, you can override these visual properties (color, style, and width).\nWhen the annotation is not on any layer, this property returns an undefined value. You can use the\nIAnnotation::Layer\nproperty to determine the name of the layer that this annotation is on. If an empty string is returned by the Annotation::Layer property, then this property is not used.\nWhen you get this property, the returned bit value indicates which property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are:\ncolor = 0x1\nstyle = 0x2\nwidth = 0x4\nTherefore, if the value was returned as 3, you know color and style have been specifically set for this item and might not match the default values associated with this item's layer.\nWhen you set this property, the input bit value indicates which property or properties should maintain their current override values. Therefore, if the value is passed as 0x4, we know width should keep its current override value, and that color and style should be reset to use the color and style settings for the item's layer. If you pass 0, all visual properties are reset to use the default settings of the item's layer.",
