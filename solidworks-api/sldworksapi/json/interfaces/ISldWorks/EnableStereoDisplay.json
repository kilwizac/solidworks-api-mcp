  "remarks": "You must select the\nEnable Quadbuffered Stereo API\ncheck box for NVIDIA Quadro\n4 OpenGL video cards before opening any windows.\nCalling this method with bit #0, the low bit, of the flags field set (flags |= 0x01) sets up all subsequently opened document windows to be capable of displaying stereo; already opened document windows are not affected. If this method is not called, or if it is called with the low bit of flags cleared, the document windows are not be capable of displaying stereo.\nBit #1 controls whether or not3D scenes are displayed to separate left-eye and right-eye stereoscopic buffers. If bit #1 of the flags field is set (flags |= 0x02), separately buffered stereo pairs are rendered for all windows with 3D scenes that are capable of displaying stereo.\nThus, any plug-in that might need to display stereoscopically should, upon loading, immediately call this method, with the flags field set to 0x01. To actually activate stereo display, call this method with the flags field set to 0x03. To deactivate stereo display, call this method with the flags field set to 0x01. Finally, just before the plug-in uninstalls, restore SOLIDWORKS' default behavior by calling this method with the flags field set to 0x00.\nFor the stereo pair renderings to appear stereoscopic, call\nIModelView::SetStereoSeparation\nor\nIModelView::ISetStereoSeparation\n. By default, the stereo rendering-control attributes that are set by IModelView::SetStereoSeparation or IModelView::ISetStereoSeparation\nare set for identical left-eye and right-eye renderings.",
