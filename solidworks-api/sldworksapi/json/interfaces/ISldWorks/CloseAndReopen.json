  "remarks": "Before a third-party application can process a drawing document that is open in SOLIDWORKS, it must close the document. Usually when a drawing document is closed, its references are unloaded from memory, and reopening the drawing document takes a lot of time. This method closes a drawing document, keeps its references in memory, and quickly reopens it.\nAfter the drawing document is closed and before it is reopened, SOLIDWORKS fires a\nFileCloseNotify\nevent with reason\nswFileCloseNotifyReason_e.swFileCloseNotifyReason_CloseForReload\n. In the handler of this event, a third-party application can call\nISldWorks::SetPromptFileName2\nto open a different file, or it can process the specified document before it is reopened in SOLIDWORKS.\nSee\nIModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace\nto perform a similar function with part and assembly documents.",
