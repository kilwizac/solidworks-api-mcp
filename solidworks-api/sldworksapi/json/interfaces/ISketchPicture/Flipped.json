  "returns": "True if the picture has been flipped either side to side or top to bottom, false if not (see Remarks )",
  "remarks": "When a picture has not been flipped, as when you initially insert it, the bottom of the picture is defined by starting at the origin and proceeding in the direction of the\nangle\n. If a picture has been flipped, then the bottom of the picture is defined by starting at the origin and proceeding in a direction opposite the angle. In other words, the picture is mirrored or reflected, but not duplicated.\nIf a picture has been\nflipped\nboth side to side and top to bottom, then this property returns false.",
