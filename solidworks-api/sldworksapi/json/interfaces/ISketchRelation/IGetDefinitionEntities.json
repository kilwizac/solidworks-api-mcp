  "remarks": "When you created a sketch relation, an internal entity may have also been created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you added a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may have been created. If this happened, then\nISketchRelation::GetEntities\nand\nISketchRelation::IGetEntities\nwould return the point and sketch segment. To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call\nISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities\nor ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities.\nBecause some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.\nBefore calling this method, call\nISketchRelation::GetEntitiesCount\nto get the value for NumEntities.",
