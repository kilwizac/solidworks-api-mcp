  "remarks": "When you create a sketch relation, an internal entity may also be created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you add a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may be created. If this happens, then\nISketchRelation::GetEntities\nand ISketchRelation::IGetEntities return the point and sketch segment. To get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call\nISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities\nor\nISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities\n.\nBecause some of the objects may be NULL, you should check for this before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.\nBefore calling this method, call\nISketchRelation::GetEntitiesCount\nto get the value for NumEntities.",
