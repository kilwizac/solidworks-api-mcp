  "remarks": "The model to reload or replace must be open in its own window frame.\nThis method:\nprovides a performance improvement over\nIModelDocExtension::ReloadOrReplace\n(when its ForceReload parameter is set to True).\nis faster because it reloads only a selection of referenced components.\ndoes not reload or replace the model if the top assembly has been opened invisibly. In that case, make the model visible by calling\nIModelDoc2::Visible\nbefore calling this method.\nmust be called after calling\nIModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks\n, which detaches a file from the file system, to re-attach a detached file to the file system. If you do not call this method after calling IModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks, then you will experience problems with OLE objects (e.g., design tables). Any changes made to a file while it is detached are not preserved unless you save the file to disk before calling this method. Additionally if you set this method's DiscardChanges parameter to false and you made changes to a detached file that you are attempting to re-attach to the file system, then this method will fail. DiscardChanges must be set to true to re-attach a detached file.\nSee\nISldWorks::CloseAndReopen\nto perform a similar function with drawing documents.",
