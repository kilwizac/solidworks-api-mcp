  "remarks": "The method performs intersection operations between the specified bodies and the specified ray vectors. To get the results (a set of intersection points, intersection normals, and the bodies from your BodiesIn array that were hit), you must call\nIModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionsPoints\nand\nIModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionTopology\n.\nInformation returned by IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionsPoints and IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionTopology depends partially on the value of the Options parameter. Valid Option values can be combined using bitwise operations. See IModelDoc2::GetRayIntersectionsPoints to determine which data is always output regardless of the values specified by Options.\nFor each ray that hits an edge or a vertex, the Offset value is added in both the positive and negative directions along the ray, and the points computed are tested for spatial inclusion in the hit body. This determines whether the ray was entering, leaving, or just grazing the body at the hit point. Entry and exit for faces can be computed and does not require an offset.\nThe difference between this method and the now obsolete IModelDoc2::RayIntersections and IModelDoc2::IRayIntersections is the HighPrecision parameter. Setting HighPrecision to true forces use of the highest possible precision when evaluating intersections close to ray profile boundaries. Setting HighPrecision to false forces use of a dynamic tolerance that is based on the HitRadius, which is the behavior of the obsolete methods.\nThe actual ray profile is polygonal, approximating an ideal circular ray profile of HitRadius. Evaluating intersections very close to the ray profile boundary may produce unexpected results due to this polygonal approximation. Experimentation with HighPrecision is recommended.",
