To reorder a cut list folder in another configuration, you must make it active before calling this method.\nreturns false if you try to move of a cut list/solid body folder to the top using either MoveLocation = swMoveLocation_e.swMoveToTop or MoveLocation = swMoveLocation_e.swMoveBefore. For example, if TargetFeat is the top folder, then you cannot set MoveLocation to swMoveLocation_e.swMoveBefore.\nUse\nIBodyFolder::GetTopLevelFeatureCount\nand\nIBodyFolder::GetTopLevelFeatures\nto obtain top level folders in a body folder.",
