  "remarks": "The Properties array contains four longs (placed in the first four doubles in the array):\nDimension\nOrder\nNumber of Control Points\nPeriodicity ( true or false)\nThe Knots array contains doubles with (Number of Control Points + Order) elements.\nThe size of the ControlPoints array is based upon the curve dimension.\nDimension = 2 then each Control Point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )\nDimension = 3 then each Control Point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)\nDimension = 4 then each Control Point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where w = weight\nThe parameters are provided as three arrays.\nPass the control point coordinates to this routine in sketch space. The Z value is\ninterpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your B-curve parameters to sketch space using\nISketch::ModelToSketchTransform\n.\nNOTE:\nThe curve can be either periodic or non-periodic. If the generated spline is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. Additionally, splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected and a spline is not created. If your data is not G1 continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and call this method for each segment.\nThis method does not work with\nISketchManager::AddToDB\nor\nISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded\n. It always adds the spline directly to the database (as if ISketchManager::AddToDB(True) is in effect), and you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added (as if ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded(False) is in effect).\nTo create 3D splines, see\nIModelDoc2::InsertCurveFilePoint\nand related functions.",
