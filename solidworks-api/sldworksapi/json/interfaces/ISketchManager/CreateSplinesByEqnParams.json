  "remarks": "The Properties array contains four longs (placed in the first four doubles in the array):\nDimension\nOrder\nNumber of Control Points\nPeriodicity ( true or false)\nThe Knots array contains doubles with (Number of Control Points + Order) elements.\nThe size of the ControlPoints array is based upon the curve dimension.\nDimension = 2 then each Control Point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )\nDimension = 3 then each Control Point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)\nDimension = 4 then each Control Point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where w = weight\nThe parameters are provided as three arrays.\nPass the control point coordinates to this routine in sketch space. The Z value is\ninterpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your B-curve parameters to sketch space using\nISketch::ModelToSketchTransform\n.\nNOTE:\nIf the spline being generated is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. If the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it creates multiple G1 continuous spline segments.\nThis method does not work with\nISketchManager::AddToDB\nor\nISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded\n. It always adds the spline directly to the database (as if ISketchManager::AddToDB(True) is in effect), and you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added (as if ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded(False) is in effect).\nTo create 3D splines, see\nIModelDoc2::InsertCurveFilePoint\nand related functions.",
