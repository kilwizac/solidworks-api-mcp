  "remarks": "This method creates a point in the active 2D or 3D sketch. If a sketch is not active, the point is not created and NULL is returned. Use\nISketchManager::ActiveSketch\nto check to see if the sketch is active.\nISketchManager::AddToDB\nand\nISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded\nincrease performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database. ISketchManager::AddToDB also avoids inferencing.",
