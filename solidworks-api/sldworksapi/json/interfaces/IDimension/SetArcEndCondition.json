  "remarks": "Linear dimensions measure the distance from one point to another. If one or both of those points is on an arc, the point can be changed to the center point of the arc, the nearest point on the arc, or the furthest point on the arc. The arc end condition describes which point to use.\nUse\nIDimension::GetArcEndCondition\nto get the arc end conditions.\nTo see the effects of changing the arc endpoint conditions, use\nIModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2\nto redraw the graphics window.",
