  "remarks": "This method allows an application to provide an XYZ position to a selected object at the given index in the\nISelectionMgr\nobject. This XYZ position represents a world-coordinate location in the context of that ISelectionMgr object.\nThe index starts at 1, even when using C++. However, if you specify -1 for the Index argument, then the Mark argument is ignored and the dynamically highlighted view is selected if dynamic highlighting is turned on. See also IAssemblyDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, IDrawingDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, and IPartDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n.",
