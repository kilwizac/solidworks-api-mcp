  "remarks": "The selection point is projected on to the currently active sketch, resulting in a z value of 0.00.\nIf a sketch is not currently active, then the return value is the same as that returned by\nISelectionMgr::GetSelectionPoint2\nor\nISelectionMgr::IGetSelectionPoint2\n. You can determine if a sketch is active by checking for a null return value from\nIModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2\nor\nIModelDoc2::IGetActiveSketch2\n.\nThe index starts at 1. However, if you specify -1 for the Index argument, then the Mark argument is ignored and the dynamically highlighted view is selected if dynamic highlighting is turned on. See also IAssemblyDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, IDrawingDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, and IPartDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n.",
