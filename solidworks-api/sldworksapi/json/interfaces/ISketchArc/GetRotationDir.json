  "remarks": "This method determines the direction that the sketch proceeds around this arc, beginning at the arc's start point and ending at the arc's end point. The direction is with respect to the normal of the arc's sketch plane and not with respect to the viewer.\nIf the normal to the arc's sketch plane is...\nAnd the normal to the arc is...\nAnd this method returns...\nIt means that...\n(0, 0, -1)\n(0, 0, 1)\n1 (counterclockwise)\nWith respect to its sketch plane's normal (from behind the screen), the arc travels counterclockwise from its start point to its end point.\nNote that from the perspective of the viewer (in front of the screen), the arc travels clockwise from its start point to its end point.",
