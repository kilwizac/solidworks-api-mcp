  "remarks": "This method is used with a set of related methods that construct a body from trimmed surfaces. This method takes an ISurface object created elsewhere and adds it to the temporary body object, which acts as a placeholder for the trimmed surfaces.\nFollow calls to this method with one or more calls to the trimming-curve creation methods, such as\nISurface::AddTrimmingLoop2\n. Then, trim the surface using\nIBody2::CreateTrimmedSurface\n. After you add all the surfaces to the body and trim appropriately, you can sew the body to create an imported SOLIDWORKS body feature using\nIBody2::CreateBodyFromSurfaces\n.",
