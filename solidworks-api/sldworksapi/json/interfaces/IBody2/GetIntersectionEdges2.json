  "returns": "Array of edges",
  "remarks": "This method imprints a set of edges on both of the bodies and returns the edges in an unordered list as shown below. The total number of edges in the returned array is twice the value returned by\nIBody2::IGetIntersectionEdgeCount\n.\n[\nEdge1imprintedOnTarget, Edge1imprintedOnTool, Edge2imprintedOnTarget, Edge2imprintedOnTool\n]\nwhere\nTarget\nis this IBody2 object, and\nTool\nis the IBody2 object passed into this method as ToolBodyIn.\nIf the two bodies are in an assembly, then this method generates a list of the intersection edges between the two bodies. Before calling this method, the two bodies must be aligned. To align the two bodies, calculate the transformation from the first body to the second body and then apply the transform to the second body using\nIBody2::ApplyTransform\n.\nIn the case of a tangency condition (for example, a planar face contacting the cylindrical face of a cylinder), this method returns a single edge along the tangency.\nYou might also find that\nIBody2::Operations2\nprovides an adequate solution when intersecting a sheet body with a target body.\nAddFaceIds allows you to add IDs to any newly created faces. This may be useful if ToolBodyIn later becomes a permanent body, which can occur in macro features.",
