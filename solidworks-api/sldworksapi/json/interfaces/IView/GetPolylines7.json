  "remarks": "The difference between this method and\nIView::GetPolyLinesAndCurves\nand\nIView::IGetPolyLinesAndCurves\nis that splines and ellipses returned by these methods are returned as equation parameters, which are more precise definitions.\nThis method returns data for all visible solid model edges in the drawing view. This includes these types of edges:\narcs: Returned using a center point, radius, and start and stop location.\ncircles: Returned using a center point, radius, and start and stop location.\nellipses: Returned as tessellated polylines.\nsplines: Returned as tessellated polylines.\nstraight lines: Returned as tessellated polylines, but because the edges are straight, there is no loss of data in the approximation.\nNOTE\n: If the view contains silhouette edges, then the polylines that render them cannot correspond to an edge because an edge does not actually exist. For example, if the third and fourth polyline in the set of polylines returned describe a silhouette edge, then array positions 4 and 5 in the edge array will be null.\nThis method also lets you include or exclude crosshatch lines. This method does not return data for sketch segments added by a user in the drawing view.\nTo get...\nCall...\nSize of array needed to hold this data\nIView::GetPolylineCount5\nItems that were sketched in this drawing view\nIView::GetArcs4\nand\nIView::IGetArcs4\nIView::GetLines4\nand\nIView::IGetLines4\nIView::GetSplines3\nand\nIView::IGetSplines3\nIView::GetEllipses5\nand\nIView::IGetEllipses5\nFormat of the return value is the following array of doubles:\n[\nType, GeomDataSize, GeomData[ ], LineColor, LineStyle, LineFont, LineWeight, LayerID, LayerOverride, NumPolyPoints, [x,y,z]\n]\nwhere:\nType\n=\nunderlying geometry type, possible values are:\n0 Polyline type\n1 Arc or Circle type\nGeomDataSize\n= number of elements in the\nGeomData\narray, for Type = 0 this will be 0.\nGeomData[ ]\n= geometric data that can be used to represent the underlying geometry type. The data returned in this array is based on the underlying geometry type:\nType\n= 0. This array is empty\nType\n= 1.\n[\ncenterPtX, centerPtY, centerPtZ, startPtX, startPtY, startPtZ, endPtX, endPtY, endPtZ, normalX, normalY, normalZ\n]\nLineColor\n= polyline color. This value is determined either by the explicitly set value or by the layer that the polyline is on.\nLineStyle\n= value combines polyline font and weight information. This value can be used as an input to GetLineFontInfo and GetLineFontName. If this value is -1, then the user has probably modified the line display manually in the drawing and you should use the LineFont and LineWeight return values to recreate the exact polyline style.\nLineFont\n= value is used for polyline font information. This value can be used as an input to the GetLineFontInfo2 and GetLineFontName2 functions. This value will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.\nLineWeight\n= polyline weight where Thin = 0.0, Normal = 1.0, Thick = 2.0. This value will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.\nLayerID\n= integer value indicating which layer holds this polyline. The\nILayer\nobject can be obtained by passing this integer value to\nILayerMgr::GetLayerById\nand\nILayerMgr::IGetLayerById\n.\nLayerOverride\n= integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore, if LayerOverride was returned as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer.\nNumPolyPoints\n= number of XYZ points found in the [x,y,z] return value\n[\nx,y,z]\n= array of points used to describe the polyline. This array has NumPolyPoints points. This data will be returned for every polyline regardless of\nType\n.\nIf...\nThen...\nDisplay mode of the view is:\nShaded\nShaded with Edges\nDraft Quality\nFast HLR/HLV\nA value is not returned.\nUse\nIView::SetDisplayMode3\nto change Shaded or Shaded with Edges mode to Wireframe, Hidden Lines Removed (HLR), or Hidden Lines Visible (HLV), and then get the polylines.\nChanges are made to the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing\nPolylines are only generated that are in the visible viewing bounds when the drawing is opened.\nDrawing is already open\nAll polylines in the drawing are generated. If you open a drawing that is zoomed in to a particular region, then the polylines that are outside the zoomed region do not exist if the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing have been changed. To force the generation of all possible polyline data, call\nIModelDoc2::ViewZoomtofit2\n.",
