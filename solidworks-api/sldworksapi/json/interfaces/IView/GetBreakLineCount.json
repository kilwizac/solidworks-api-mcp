  "remarks": "This method indicates the number of break lines in the view; it does not indicate if the view is broken.\nA drawing view can have break lines without the break being applied. To determine whether a view is broken, use\nIView::IsBroken\n.\nA break in a drawing view consists of a pair of lines. This method returns the number of breaks in the view, not the number of break lines. For example, this method returns 3 for a view that has three breaks in it, even though there are three pairs (or six lines) on the display.\nCall this method before calling\nIView::IGetBreakLines\nto determine the size of the array for that method.",
