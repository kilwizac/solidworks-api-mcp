  "remarks": "This method only works for base drawing views; it does not work for projected or auxiliary views.\nMultiple projection lines can exist in a view. This method returns the interface for each projection line so that an application such as DXF/DWG translation can create the projection lines with the base drawing view rather than creating those lines when cycling through the views and finding a projected or auxiliary view.\nBefore calling this method, call\nIView::GetProjectionLineCount\nto get the value for Count.",
