  "remarks": "The first two values returned are the X and Y locations of the view relative to the sheet origin, and the third value returned is the scale of the drawing view.\nBecause of a Microsoft compilation issue, the Dispatch name generated in the\nswdisp.h\nand\nswdisp.cpp\nfiles for the Dispatch version of this method is GetXform (with a lower-case letter f). To work around this:\nUse GetXform in your code instead of GetXForm.\n- or -\nModify the swdisp.h and swdisp.cpp files so that the declaration for GetXForm in the\nIView\nobject is changed to GetXform. Remember to change it when you upgrade the SOLIDWORKS Design software.\nIView::GetViewXform\nand\nIView::IGetViewXform\nget the transform from model space origin to drawing space origin.",
