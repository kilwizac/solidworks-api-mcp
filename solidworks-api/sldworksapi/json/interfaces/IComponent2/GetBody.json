  "description": "Gets the body that belongs to this instance of this component.",
  "signature": "System.Object GetBody()",
  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "Body",
  "remarks": "This method returns a valid IBody2 object only for fully resolved components that reference an\nIPartDoc\n. For the root component, lightweight components or components that reference an AssemblyDoc, this method returns a NULL body object. However, if a component is in a multibody part, then this method returns the first body.\nFor COM applications, this method returns the status code ITF_E_COMPONENTNOTRESOLVED.\nThis method is different from the IPartDoc::Body method in that it recognizes assembly-level features and returns that information based on the component instance. IPartDoc::Body never recognizes assembly-level features because the feature information is kept with the assembly, not propagated down to the part file.\nFor example, if PartABC is added to an assembly twice, then changes to that IPartDoc object would affect both instances of the assembly IComponent2. Likewise, querying information from that IPartDoc object will not recognize changes in the assembly that may have altered only one of the components (for example, an assembly-level feature was added to one of the components). However, the component object recognizes the two instances of PartABC as two distinct IComponent2 objects and returns its information from the assembly level.\nFor example, one assembly configuration might have an assembly-level feature that cuts a hole through each of the components in the assembly. Using this method on each of the assembly components returns the body of each component with the hole feature that was applied in this particular configuration. If you switch to the configuration\nwithout the assembly-level hole and re-traverse the IComponent2 objects, then calling this method for each component returns the IBody2 object without the hole feature because it was applied in the other configuration.\nFor more information on lightweight components, see\nIComponent2::GetSuppression\n,\nIComponent2::SetSuppression2\n, and\nIAssemblyDoc::ResolveAllLightWeightComponents\n.",
