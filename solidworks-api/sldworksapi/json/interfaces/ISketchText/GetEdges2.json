  "remarks": "The difference between this method and the now obsolete ISketchText::GetEdges is this method also gets the edges of sketch text rendered with \"stick\" or single line fonts such as OLF SimpleSansOC.\nThe edges returned by this method are transient and should be regarded as read only. They can be used to obtain the underlying\nICurve\nobjects, but should not be used for manipulation or to obtain any other objects. These pointers should not be saved; if they are needed again, they should be obtained at that time.",
