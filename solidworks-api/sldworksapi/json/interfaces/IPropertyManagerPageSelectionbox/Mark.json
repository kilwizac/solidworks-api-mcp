  "remarks": "You can only use this method to set properties on the PropertyManager page before it is displayed or while it is closed. See\nIPropertyManagerPage2::Show2\nand\nIPropertyManagerPage2::Close\n.\nIt is easiest to use the Mark property as a read-only property. If this property is not set before the PropertyManager is shown, then the Mark value is automatically set. Once the PropertyManager page is displayed, then the application can query the Mark for its value.\nIf the application must rely on specific mark values for specific selection boxes, then the set the Mark value before the PropertyManager page is shown. In this case, ensure that each selection box contains a different value. Otherwise, the user's selection is displayed in the selection boxes that have the same Mark value.\nMark values (whether set by the SOLIDWORKS Design application or by your application) must be powers of two (for example, 1, 2, 4, 8).",
