  "remarks": "This method only works for parts having multiple configurations created in SOLIDWORKS 2014 or later. Use this method to add dimension equations, component equations, or global variable assignments to various configurations of models. If you don't have multiple configurations, then call\nIEquationMgr::Add2\n, which does not support configurations and is slightly faster.\nTo add an equation using the SOLIDWORKS Design user interface, you must embed the names of dimensions and global variables in double quotes:\nGlobal variable assignment:\n\"B\" = 2\nComponent equation:\n\"N_SPOKES@CirPattern\" = \"BARLENGTH@Sketch2\" /10\nDimension equation that uses the Visual Basic IIf function:\n\"D1@Extrude2\" = (IIf(\"D1@Extrude3\">20, 15, 6))+5\nDimension equation that sets a dimension to the current value:\n\"D1@Extrude2\" =\nNOTE:\nTo add an equation:\nyou must specify Equation with the names of dimensions and global variables in double double quotes and the entire equation in double quotes. See the Examples.\ndirectly to an assembly component's model, you must call\nIAssemblyDoc::EditPart2\nbefore calling this method.\nYou can add a dimension equation whose left-hand side already exists, but only if the existing equation is suppressed. Adding the equation again unsuppresses it. See\nIEquationMgr::ChangeSuppressionForAllConfigurations\nand\nIEquationMgr::ChangeSuppressionForConfiguration\n.\nSetting Solve to false delays evaluation of this equation, which enhances performance when there are many equations to solve. When Solve is set to false, the equation appears in the FeatureManager design tree only after calling\nIEquationMgr::EvaluateAll\nor\nIModelDoc2::EditRebuild3\n.\nWhen adding global variable assignments and component equations, WhichConfigurations must be set to\nswInConfigurationOpts_e\n.swAllConfiguration.\nIf you add a global variable assignment that already exists, this method returns an error.\nTo modify an equation added by this method, call\nIEquationMgr::SetEquationAndConfigurationOption\n.\nWhen you add an equation, you are adding it to the list of relations. Thus, do not add an equation while traversing the equations in a model, because SOLIDWORKS could crash.",
