  "remarks": "The seed position is the index of a pattern instance, feature, or component that is part of an existing pattern and is used to drive the derived pattern feature.\nThe total number of seed positions = total number of pattern instances in the pattern used to create the derived pattern feature.\nIf the pattern used to create the derived pattern has pattern instances in Direction 1 and Direction 2, then the total number of seed positions = ((Number pattern instances in Direction 1) * (Number pattern instances in Direction 2) - 1).\nSetting the seed position outside of the range of pattern instances is silently rejected, and the seed position remains unchanged.\nSee\nAccessing Selections that Define Features\nfor additional details on using this property.",
