You can use\nIModelDoc2::FirstFeature\n,\nIFeature::GetFirstSubFeature\n, and\nIFeature::GetNextSubFeature\nto traverse the FeatureManager design tree and get the derived-pattern feature's subfeatures.\nTransform each instance by calling this method, setting its parameter\nInstance\nas follows:\n1 <=\nInstance\n<= total number of instances in this pattern",
