  "remarks": "The VP0 parameter contains the following values, which you can obtain by using\nISurface::Parameterization\nor\nISurface::IParameterization\n:\nvP0[0] & vP0[2] are the lower bounds of the U & V surface parameters, respectively\nvP0[1] &\nvP0[3] are the upper bounds of the U & V surface parameters, respectively\nIf you want to use the Bsurface in combination with its trim curves, you should use the\nIFace2::GetTrimCurves2\nmethod to extract the trim curves and the Bsurface. The IFace2::GetTrimCurves2 method provides much better alignment of the trim curves with the Bsurface because they are both generated at the same time.\nEvaluation is as follows:\nNumber of returned double elements is (4 + NumUKnots + NumVKnots + NumControlPointDoubles), where NumUKnots = (NumColumnsControlPoints + Uorder) and NumVKnots = (NumRowsControlPoints + Vorder).\nThe returned data are arranged in this order:\nUorder, Vorder - These are two ints packed into a double\nUorder - Order of surface in U direction\nVorder - Order of surface in V direction\nNumColumnsControlPoints, NumRowsControlPoints - These are two integers packed into a double\nNumColumnsControlPoints - Number of columns for the control points\nNumRowsControlPoints - Number of rows for the control points\nUperiodicity, Vperiodicity - These are two integers packed into a double. Since you may be generating a Bsurface with this function, the U,V periodicity values may be opposite from the original surface. Refer to ISurface::Parameterization or ISurface::IParameterization.\nUperiodicity - True if surface is periodic in U direction\nVperiodicity - True if surface is periodic in V direction\nDimensionControlPoints, dummy - These are two integers packed into a double\nDimensionControlPoints - Dimension for control points.\nDimensionControlPoints = 3 for non-rational surfaces and control point coordinates are output as [x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,.........].\nDimensionControlPoints = 4 for rational surfaces and control point coordinates and the weight are output as [x0,y0,z0,w0,x1,y1,z1,w1,........].\ndummy - a system-used filler.\nUKnots - Knot vector in the u direction.\nThere will be (NumColumnsControlPoints + Uorder) knot values. If the surface is periodic in the U direction, then data is converted and returned in a non-periodic form with additional knots added to the surface ends.\nVKnots - Knot vector in the v direction.\nThere will be (NumRowsControlPoints + Vorder) knot values. If the surface is periodic in the V direction, then data is converted and returned in a non-periodic form with additional knots added to the surface ends.\nControlPoints - This is a list of control points output in (NumColumnsControlPoints*NumRowsControlPoints) vectors of dimension DimensionControlPoints. The vectors are output row by row. The U direction of surface is in the row direction. The V direction of surface is in the column direction.\nFor non-rational surfaces, control point coordinates are output as [x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,.........].\nFor rational surfaces, control point coordinates and the weight are output as [x0,y0,z0,w0,x1,y1,z1,w1,........].\nFor example:\nRow1, Column1\nRow1, Column2\nx0, y0, z0\nx1, y1, z1\n= 6\nRow2, Column1\nRow2, Column2\nx2, y2, z2\nx3, y3, z3\n= 6\nRow3, Column1\nRow3, Column2\nx4, y4, z4\nx5, y5, z5\n= 6\n= 18",
