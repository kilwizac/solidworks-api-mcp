  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "Properties that have been overridden or should be overridden as defined in swLayerOverride_e (see Remarks )",
  "remarks": "Currently, only SOLIDWORKS drawing documents support layers.\nYou should set this property only when you want to reset specific visual properties to the default visual properties of the owning layer. If you want to change or set specific values for the visual property of this component, use\nIDrawingComponent::Style\nor\nIDrawingComponent::Width\n.\nIn drawing documents, components can be created on a layer that has specific visual properties. By default, the component takes on the visual properties defined by the layer. However, for a specific component, you can override these visual properties (style or width).\nWhen the component is not on any layer, this property returns an undefined value. You can use\nIDrawingComponent::Layer\nto determine the name of the layer that this component is on. If an empty string is returned by this property, then this property is not used.\nWhen you get this property, the returned bit value indicates which properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are:\ncolor = 0x1\nstyle = 0x2\nwidth = 0x4\nTherefore, if the return value is returned as 2, then you know style has been specifically set for this component and might not match the default value associated with this component's layer.\nWhen you set this property, the input bit value indicates which properties should maintain their current override values. Therefore, if the return value is passed as 0x4, you know width should keep its current override value and style should be reset to use the style settings for the component's layer. If you pass 0, all visual properties are reset to use the default settings of the component's layer.",
