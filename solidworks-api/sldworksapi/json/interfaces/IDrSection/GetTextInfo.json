  "remarks": "The section line in a drawing view usually has a piece of text near each end of the line, typically the section view label (\nIDrSection::GetLabel\n). The array returned by this method consists of 6 doubles, the (X, Y, Z) origin of one text followed by the (X, Y, Z) origin of the other text. The origin is the upper-left corner of the text.\nThese values are the same as some of the information in the array returned by\nIView::GetSectionLineInfo2\n. The text information in that array also contains the text height. This method returns an array that does not include that information, but you can get it using\nIDrSection::GetTextFormat\nand\nITextFormat::CharHeight\n.",
