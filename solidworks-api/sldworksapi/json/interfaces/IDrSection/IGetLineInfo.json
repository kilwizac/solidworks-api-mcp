  "returns": "in-process, unmanaged C++: Pointer to an array of doubles (see Remarks ) VBA, VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI: Not supported See In-process Methods for details about this type of method.",
  "remarks": "This method returns an array that consists of several coordinate pairs. The number of coordinate pairs is determined by the number of line segments in the section line.\nCall\nDrSection::IGetLineSegmentCount\nand multiply that number by 6 to get the size for the array. Each coordinate pair consists of 6 doubles, the (X, Y, Z) coordinate of each end point of the segment.\nThese values are the same as some of the information in the array returned by the\nIView::IGetSectionLineInfo2\n. The line segment information in that array also contains the line style. The array returned by this method does not contain that information because it is a document-level setting, and cannot be controlled per section line. Use\nIModelDocExtension::GetUserPreferenceInteger\nor\nIModelDocExtension::SetUserPreferenceInteger\nwith swLineFontSectionLineStyle to get or set that value.",
