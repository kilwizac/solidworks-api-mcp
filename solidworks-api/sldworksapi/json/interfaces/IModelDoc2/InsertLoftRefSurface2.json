  "remarks": "Selection of guide curves and centerline is optional; however, selection of the profiles must be in an order consistent with the desired direction of the loft. Because you are creating a surface, the section profiles can be open.\nUse of guide curves is strongly recommended, especially when selection of profiles is done in the FeatureManager design tree.\nYou can use any number of profiles; however, if you have selected only one profile, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves.\nUse\nIModelDocExtension::SelectByID2\nto select the profiles and guide curves. The mark for:\nprofile selections should be 1\nany guide curve selection, if provided, should be 2\ncenterline selection, if provided, should be 4\nstart tangency vector selection, if provided, should be an 8\nstart tangency faces selection, if provided, should be a 16 (not available currently\nend tangency vector selection, if provided, should be a 32\nend tangency faces selection, if provided, should be a 64 (not available currently)\nLinear edge, sketch line, axis, plane and planar faces are qualified for tangency vector sections.\nThe tangency types can be one of the following:\n0\n=\nnone\n1\n=\ntangent to the normal of the profile\n2\n=\ntangent to a selected vector\n3\n=\ntangency to all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile\n4\n=\ntangent to some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start profile (not available at this moment).",
