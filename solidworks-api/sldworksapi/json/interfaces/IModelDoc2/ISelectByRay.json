  "remarks": "This method:\nDefines a cylindrical region of infinite length that begins at pointIn, runs parallel to VectorIn, and has a radius of RadiusIn. If you specified edge or vertex entities, then the first edge or vertex found within the selection cylinder is selected.\nOnly selects entity objects, which include faces, edges, vertices, and so on. You cannot select sketch objects using this method.\nDoes not support the selection of silhouette edges.\nOnly a single entity is selected within the distance radius regardless of multiple entities existing within that radius. For selecting face entities, RadiusIn is ignored and a cylinder of infinitely small radius is used.\nUse model space view to determine the selection vector in a drawing.",
