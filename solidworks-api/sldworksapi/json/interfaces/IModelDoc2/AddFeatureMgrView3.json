  "remarks": "This method is not valid in the context of the Microsoft .NET Framework; it is only valid for old-style add-ins, which are now obsolete. Instead, use\nIModelViewManager::CreateFeatureMgrControl3\n, which allows you to provide the ProgID or CLSID of an ActiveX control to use in the new tab for the FeatureManager design tree.\nThis method is identical to the earlier version, IModelDoc2::AddFeatureMgrView2, except that this method provides the ability to place the new tab on either the top or bottom pane. The pane may or may not be visible. However, the tab is added to the specified pane. Only the values swFeatMgrPaneTop and swFeatMgrPaneBottom from swFeatMgrPane_e should be used as inputs in the whichPane argument.\nUnder certain conditions, for example while the\nSurface, Extend\ncommand is active in the user interface, SOLIDWORKS locks the bottom pane and does not allow the activation of any other tab. If your application needs the ability to activate your new tab at all times, consider adding it either to the top pane or to both panes. If you add it to the top pane only, it may not be apparent to the user until the top pane is made visible.\nIf you have an existing CView, this method adds that view as a new FeatureManager design tree view. This method also provides a parameter for adding a tab, which the user clicks to activate your view.\nThe FeatureManager design tree view added to this document is not persistent. In other words, the FeatureManager design tree view is not stored with this document and must be recreated upon reloading the document.\nThis method does not receive\nIFeatMgrView::ActivateNotify\nand\nIFeatMgrView::DeactivateNotify\nevents.\nThis view is generated by you and can be drawn into as you desire. However, because you generated this view, you are responsible for deleting it. See\nIModelDoc2::DeleteFeatureMgrView\nand\nIModelDocExtension::DeleteFeatureMgrViewx64\nfor details on how to delete your Feature Manager view.",
