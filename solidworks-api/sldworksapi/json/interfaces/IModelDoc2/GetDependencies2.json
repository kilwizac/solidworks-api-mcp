  "returns": "Array of strings; there are two strings for each document returned in this list of dependent files: first string is the file name second string is the filename with the complete pathname NOTE: This combination repeats itself for each dependent file found for this IModelDoc2.",
  "remarks": "Calling this method on a drawing document returns a list of all the parts and assemblies used in the drawing. If you set Traverseflag to True, then each of the parts within the assembly file is also returned in this array of strings.\nBecause a derived mirror part is generated from another part, the list of model dependencies returned by this method would include the original part used to generate the derived mirror part.\nLibrary features are completely unassociated. They do not require the library nor do they update when changes are made to the library feature. Therefore, this method does not return library features.\nIf you use this method with an assembly that contains two documents, Part1 and SubAssem1, an example of what might be returned is:\n[\n\"Part1\", \"C:\\temp\\Part1.SLDPRT\", \"SubAssem1\", \"c:\\temp\\SubAssem1.SLDASM\"\n]\nIf Traverseflag is set to True, then all the documents contained in SubAssem1.ASM are returned. Also, suppressed components are recognized and returned by this method as a dependent file.\nIf AddReadOnlyInfo is set to True, then a string of True or false is added to the list of strings. If Part1 is read-only, then the resulting set of strings would be:\n[\n\"Part1\", \"C:\\temp\\Part1.SLDPRT\", \"True\", \"SubAssem1\", \"c:\\temp\\SubAssem1.SLDASM\", \"\"\n]\nNOTE\n:\nFor assemblies containing suppressed or lightweight components, file references (return value from this method) point to the as-saved component reference because the actual component has not been loaded into memory. Because the suppressed and lightweight components have not actually been loaded, the current search criteria has not been applied to update the file references. Setting Searchflag to True vs. false, causes this method to apply the current search criteria rules to locate the particular reference and may result in a different return value. Likewise, unsuppressing or resolving these components causes the current search criteria to be applied and updates the assembly's component references in memory, if necessary.\nWhen calling this method with Seachflag set to True, you can explicitly set the search folders first. This is important because this method uses the current SOLIDWORKS directory as its second search criteria. Because the user may have interactively opened files from some random directory, you cannot be certain the current SOLIDWORKS directory is pointing to the desired location. You may want to consider setting the search folders to that of the document being used in this method.",
