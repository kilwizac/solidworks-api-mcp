  "description": "Gets whether the display data of a leader is included as lines when the lines are retrieved from a view or annotation in this document.",
  "signature": "System.Boolean GetConsiderLeadersAsLines()",
  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "True if leaders are returned as line data, false if leaders are not returned as line data",
  "remarks": "The various GetLeaderCount and GetLeaderAtIndex mehtods return information about where the vertices of the leader are located. These methods also return the leader information as part of its line information.\nDepending on what your program is trying to accomplish and which APIs it is using, this duplication of information may not be desirable.\nIModelDoc2::SetConsiderLeadersAsLines\ncontrols this behavior by setting a flag on the document that indicates whether the leader information should be returned as part of the line information. IModelDoc2::GetConsiderLeadersAsLines gets the current behavior for this document.",
