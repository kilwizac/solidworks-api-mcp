  "remarks": "The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which for OLE automation are packed into a single SafeArray packed as follows:\n[\nDimension, Order, Number of control Points, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension], ControlPoint2[Dimension],...\n]\nPass control point coordinates to this method in sketch space. The Z value is interpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your b-curve parameters to sketch space with the help of\nISketch::ModelToSketchTransform\n.\nNOTE:\nIf the spline being generated is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. In addition, splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected and a spline is not created. If your\ndata is not G1 continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and call method for each segment.",
