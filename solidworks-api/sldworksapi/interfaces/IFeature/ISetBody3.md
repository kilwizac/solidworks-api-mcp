# IFeature.ISetBody3

Replaces the body of the base feature.

## Signature

```csharp
System.Boolean ISetBody3( 
   Body2
BodyIn
,
   System.Boolean
ApplyUserIds
)
```
## Parameters

- `BodyIn` (Body2): Pointer to the temporary body that replaces the base feature body
- `ApplyUserIds` (System.Boolean): True applies user-defined face IDs, false does not

## Return Value

True if the body was successfully replaced, false if not

## Remarks

You must create the replacement body as an imported body using
IBody2::CreateBodyFromSurfaces
or
IBody2::ICreateTempBodyFromSurfaces
, as a copy of an imported body generated by these methods, or using translation from IGES in, STEP in, and so on.
If this feature is not the base feature or the body is not an imported body, then the method returns false.
This method replaces the base body or ref-surface body if you created either of these features from imported geometry. If child features exist, then you can use
IFace2::GetFaceId
to set the face IDs to both the old body and the replacement body before calling IFeature::ISetBody3. For example, if you are expecting a child feature on a face of the old body to be mapped to a face on the replacement body, you need to set the same ID (integer) to these two faces. This mechanism enables child features to re-attach themselves to the replacement body because IFeature::ISetBody3 cannot do this automatically.
If applyUserIds...
Then Feature::ISetBody3...
True
Tries to match the face IDs on the replacement body with IDs on the child features. This helps when re-attaching the features to the replacement body.
false
Replaces the original body with the replacement body. Face IDs are not be used to match up new faces with child features.
