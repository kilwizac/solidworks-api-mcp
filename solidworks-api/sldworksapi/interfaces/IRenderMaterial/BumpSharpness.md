# IRenderMaterial.BumpSharpness

Gets or sets the sharpness, which influences the shape of the surface finish, of this appearance.

## Signature

```csharp
System.Double BumpSharpness {get; set;}
```
## Parameters

None.

## Return Value

Sharpness

## Remarks

A higher sharpness value retains the original shape of the surface finish; a lower sharpness value filters (smoothens) the surface-finish details.
