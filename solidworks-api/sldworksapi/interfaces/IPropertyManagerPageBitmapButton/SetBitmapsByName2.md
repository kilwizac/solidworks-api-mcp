# IPropertyManagerPageBitmapButton.SetBitmapsByName2

Obsolete. Superseded by IPropertyManagerPageBitmapButton::SetBitmapsByName3.

## Signature

```csharp
System.Boolean SetBitmapsByName2( 
   System.String
BitmapOrig
,
   System.String
BitmapMaskOrig
)
```
## Parameters

- `BitmapOrig` (System.String): Full path and filename to the image in its non-selected state (see Remarks )
- `BitmapMaskOrig` (System.String): Full path and filename to the image mask (see Remarks )

## Return Value

True if the image is inserted, false if not

## Remarks

The rest of the images (selected, highlight regular, highlight selected, and disabled) are automatically generated by SOLIDWORKS. The size of the image is not restricted; you can insert an image of any size. However, the standard image size is 24-pixels wide and 24-pixels high with a margin of at least 3 blank pixels on all sides of the bitmap because this is where the button borders are drawn; i.e., any pixels in the image in these 3 outer rows and columns of pixels are obscured by the button borders.
You can specify your own image mask using the BitmapMaskOrig argument, which should display the image exactly as you created it. If you specify an empty string for BitmapMaskOrig, then SOLIDWORKS generates what it needs; however, your image might appear blurred.
NOTE
: Portable Network Graphics images (.
png
) do not support masking. To use this method with a .png file, pass the .png file name to BitmapOrig and an empty string to BitmapMaskOrig.
You must call this method after calling either of the following methods to create the button control:
IPropertyManagerPage2::AddControl
or
IPropertyManagerPage2::IAddControl
IPropertyManagerPageGroup::AddControl
or
IPropertyManagerPageGroup::IAddControl
