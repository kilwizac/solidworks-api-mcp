# IBody2.CreateBlendSurface

Creates a constant radius rolling-ball blend surface (also known as a pipe surface) between two side surfaces.

## Signature

```csharp
System.Object CreateBlendSurface( 
   System.Object
Surface1
,
   System.Double
Range1
,
   System.Object
Surface2
,
   System.Double
Range2
,
   System.Object

   System.Int32
HaveHelpBox

)
```
## Parameters

- `Surface1` (System.Object): First side surface
- `Range1` (System.Double): Signed offset of Surface1
- `Surface2` (System.Object): Second side surface
- `Range2` (System.Double): Signed offset of Surface2
- `StartVec` (System.Object): Array of of 3 doubles representing a point close to the start of the blend spine
- `EndVec` (System.Object): Array of 3 doubles representing a point close to the end of the blend spine
- `HaveHelpVec` (System.Int32): Optional. True if help vector is provided
- `HelpVec` (System.Object): Array of 3 doubles representing the direction of the Help vector
- `HaveHelpBox` (System.Int32): Optional. True if box is provided
- `HelpBox` (System.Object): Array of 6 doubles bounding the area of interest

## Return Value

Newly created surface

## Remarks

The surface generated by this method is the path traced out when a sphere of the blend radius is rolled in contact with the two side surfaces. The center of the sphere rolls along the spine (the intersection of these two surfaces) when offset by the blend radius.
