For example, if the annotation's visibility is set to swAnnotationHalfHidden by IAnnotation::Visible , then that annotation is in a half-hidden state, which is not a permanent state. During a Hide/Show Annotations operation in a drawing, a half-hidden annotation is displayed in gray if the interactive user selects to show all annotations. Any annotation set to swAnnotationHalfHidden is hidden when the interactive user finishes using Hide/Show Annotations."
