  "remarks": "There can be 0, 1 or 2 lines in the leader line. If the GTol is not attached, there are 0 lines. Otherwise, leaders can use a straight leaderline (1 line) or a bent leaderline (2 lines). Your applications must infer the number of leader lines based on\nIGtol::IsAttached\nand\nIGtol::HasExtraLeader\n.\nIsAttached() == false implies no leaderline; therefore, no leaderline points (PointCount=0).\nHasExtraLeader() == false means that this is a straight leaderline; therefore, 1 line (PointCount=2)\nHasExtraLeader() == True means that this is a bent leaderline; therefore, 2 lines (PointCount=3)\nFormat of return information is the following array of doubles:\nretval[0] = X-coordinate of first leader point\nretval[1] = Y-coordinate of first leader point\nretval[2] = Z-coordinate of first leader point\nretval[3] = X-coordinate of second leader point\nretval[4] = Y-coordinate of second leader point\nretval[5] = Z-coordinate of second leader point\nretval[6] = X-coordinate of third leader point\nretval[7] = Y-coordinate of third leader point\nretval[8] = Z-coordinate of third leader point",
