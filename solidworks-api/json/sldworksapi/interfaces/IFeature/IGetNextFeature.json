  "remarks": "This method:\nallows you to access suppressed features.\nreturns features in the current order for the model, and this order changes when the model is edited.\nYour application should not assume that:\nfeatures retain the same relative or absolute position throughout the model\u2019s lifetime. For example, you should not assume that Sketch1 always appears before Sketch2.\nany feature has a specific name. Because features can be renamed, you cannot assume that the first reference plane feature is named Plane1.\nWhen traversing the FeatureManager design tree, your application should use\nIFeature::GetTypeName2\nand\nIFeature::GetSpecificFeature2\nto identify specific features instead of relying solely on\nIFeature::Name\n.\nThis method returns features in the model definition order, which is not the same as the order displayed in the user interface. See\nITreeControlItem\nfor details.\nIFeature::GetFirstSubFeature\nand\nIFeature::IGetFirstSubFeature\nprovide access to subfeatures.",
