  "remarks": "Tessellation information is available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.\nThese triangles are intended for graphical display purposes and do not represent a tessellation that could be used, for example, by a machining application. If you need the type of accuracy associated with a machining product, you should traverse the body faces and extract the topology and geometry data to create your own faceting.\nwhere:\nFaceCount\n= number of faces on the body\nStripCount\n= total number of strips on the body\nVertexCount\nx 3 = total number of vertices. Multiplied by three to cover X,Y, and Z\nNumStrips\n= number of strips on a particular face\nVertexPerStrip\n= an array containing the number of vertex points on particular face strip\nVertexPoints\n= an array of X,Y,Z points for each vertex on the particular face strip\nBecause the returned array elements are of type float, and\nFaceCount\n,\nStripCount\n,\nVertexCount\n,\nNumStrips\n, and the elements of\nVertexPerStrip\nare integers that have been packed into the return array elements, and you must\nunpack\nthem before you can use them.\nFor example:\nsa[0] = number of faces\nsa[1] = total number of strips\nsa[2] = total number of vertices x 3 (i.e., - data values)\nFor each face:\nsa[3] = number of strips in this face\nsa[4] = number of vertices in first strip of this face\nsa[5] = number of vertices in second strip of this face\n...\nsa[3 + sa[3&cd; = number of vertices in last strip of this face\nFor each strip, i:\nsa[3 + sa[3] + 1] = X value of first vertex in this strip of the face\nsa[3 + sa[3] + 2] = Y value of first vertex in this strip of the face\nsa[3 + sa[3] + 3] = Z value of first vertex in this strip of the face\nsa[3 + sa[3] + 4] = X value of second vertex in this strip of the face\n...\nsa[3 + sa[3] + (sa[3+i] x 3)] = Z value of last vertex in this strip of the face",
