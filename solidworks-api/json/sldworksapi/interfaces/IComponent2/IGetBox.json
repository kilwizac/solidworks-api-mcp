  "returns": "Two diagonal points that bound the component; the format is a pointer to an array of 6 doubles",
  "remarks": "The resulting box encloses the object, but it might not be the tightest box.\nThe X, Y, Z points returned by SOLIDWORKS are the lower- and upper-diagonal corners that bound the component with the box sides parallel to the X, Y and Z axes. SOLIDWORKS returns box dimensions that enclose the component and are typically close to the minimum possible size.\nThe return value is an array of doubles as follows:\n[\nXCorner1, YCorner1, ZCorner1, XCorner2, YCorner2, ZCorner2\n]\nIt is possible for this method to return S_false for COM or a NULL VARIANT for Dispatch. This occurs if your application calls IComponent2::IGetBox with a component that represented a subassembly and that subassembly is not loaded. Once the subassembly is loaded, SOLIDWORKS returns the correct bounds and IComponent2::IGetBox returns S_OK.\nThe user interface behavior is the same. When the user selects a subassembly that is not loaded, there is no selection box around the subassembly. However, once the subassembly is loaded, there is a selection box.\nIMPORTANT:\nThe values returned are approximate and should not be used for comparison or calculation purposes. Furthermore, the bounding box may vary after rebuilding the model.",
