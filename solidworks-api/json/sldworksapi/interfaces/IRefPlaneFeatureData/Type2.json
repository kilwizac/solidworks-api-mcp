  "remarks": "If IRefPlaneFeatureData::Type2 returns swRefPlaneConstraintBase, then the reference plane is constraint based and was created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later. To determine if a constraint-based reference plane has angle or offset distances references, call\nIRefPlaneFeatureData::Type\n:\nswRefPlaneAngle is returned for angle references.\nswRefPlaneDistance is returned for offset distance references.\nOtherwise, the reference plane is not constraint based and was created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier. Call\nIRefPlaneFeatureData::Type\nto determine its type.\nIMPORTANT:\nReference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2010 or later are constraint based; reference planes created in SOLIDWORKS 2009 or earlier are not. See the\nRemarks\nsection in the\nIRefPlaneFeatureData interface\ntopic for details about reference planes and this interface.",
