AssemblyFeatureScope and AutoSelectComponents perform just like the configuration of the Feature Scope section on the PropertyManager page of the sweep feature:\nAssemblyFeatureScope setting\nAutoSelectComponents setting\nPropertyManager page Feature Scope setting\nFalse\nIgnored\nAll components selected\nAuto-select not visible\nTrue\nIf true, affected components are automatically selected\nIf false, manually select the affected components in the view before calling this API\nSelected components selected\nIf Auto-select is not seelcted, then manually select affected components in the view",
