A closed surface is required when FillVolume is True.\nWhen UseAutoSelect is false, the user must select the bodies that the feature will affect.\nWhen using cut or cavity features that result in multiple bodies, you cannot select to keep all of the resulting bodies or one or more selected bodies.",
