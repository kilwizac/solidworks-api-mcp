  "remarks": "The SOLIDWORKS API Freeform-related methods are intended to journal the actions performed by an interactive user while creating the feature. Because user interaction is required to create a Freeform feature, fully automating the creation of it is not possible using the SOLIDWORKS API.\nThe typical steps performed by an interactive user to create a Freeform feature are:\nSelect the face to form.\nAdd curves on the selected face. Corresponds to\nIFeatureManager::SetFreeformCurveData\n.\nAdd points on the curves. Corresponds to\nIFeatureManager::SetFreeformPointData\n.\nSpecify boundary continuity. Corresponds to\nIFeatureManager::SetFreeformBoundaryContinuity\n.\nInteractively pull or push the points to change the shape of the selected face.\nInsert the Freeform feature. Corresponds to this method, IFeatureManager::InsertFreeform2.\nRecord a macro while interactively creating a Freeform feature, then examine the macro to see the order in which the Freeform-related methods are recorded.",
