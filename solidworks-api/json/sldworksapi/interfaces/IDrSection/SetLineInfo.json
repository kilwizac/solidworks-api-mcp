  "remarks": "The VLineInfo argument is an array consisting of several coordinate pairs and is of the same format as the array returned by\nIDrSection::GetLineInfo\n. The number of coordinate pairs is determined by the number of line segments in the section line. Each coordinate pair consists of 6 doubles, the x,y,z coordinate of\neach end point of the segment.\nThe formatted array should include the start point and end point of each line segment, including the z position even though the z position is irrelevant.\nAny section line containing more than one segment contains at least one set of duplicate points. These points represent the end point of one line segment and the coincident start point of another line segment. If you change either set of points, then you must change the other set of points at the same time. These points must always be\ncoincident when calling this method.\nTo update the section view, call\nIModelDoc2::EditRebuild3\nafter calling this method.",
