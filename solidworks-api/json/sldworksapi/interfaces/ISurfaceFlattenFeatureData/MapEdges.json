By default, any entity that lies on top of a face or surface to flatten is ignored unless the user selects the entity as a map edge.\nare useful when users want to see where a selected entity on the original body would lie on a flattened surface. For example, users might select edges as map lines to serve as bend lines in the flattened surface.\ncan be any of these types of selected entities:\nedges,\nreference curves,\n2D/3D splines,\nsketches, and\nsketch text.\nThe SOLIDWORKS API returns\nedges\nfor the entities selected for the map edges in a surface-flatten feature.",
