See the SOLIDWORKS Help for details.\nThe OpenCount and ClosedCount arguments are output values. If this method returns swSketchCheckFeatureStatus_OK, meaning that the sketch can be used to create the specified feature, then these two arguments contain useful information. If this method returns something else, then OpenCount and ClosedCount both return 0.\nIf the featureType value is not valid, this method returns\nswSketchCheckFeatureStatus_UnknownError.",
