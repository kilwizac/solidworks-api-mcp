  "remarks": "An extrusion surface is constructed by extruding a profile curve (line or arc or b-spline) along a direction vector. You can retrieve the profile curve for the extrusion using\nISurface::GetProfileCurve\nor\nISurface::IGetProfileCurve\n.\nThree doubles of parameters returned,\nDirectionVector[3]\n, which is the direction vector along which the profile curve is extruded.",
