  "remarks": "The list of trimming loops is created by a previous call to one of the base surface creation functions,\nIBody2::CreateRevolutionSurface\nor\nIBody2::CreatePlanarSurface.\nThe information on each UV-curve is in b-spline form (knots and control point coordinates) and is compacted into two arrays, VKnots and VCtrlPointDbls.\nOrder of each curve in Order is, at a minimum, 2. A second order curve is a linear curve.\nFor each curve in NumCtrlPoints, Order, and NumKnots, (NumCtrlPoints >= Order) and (NumKnots = NumCtrlPoints + Order).\nDim for each curve in Dim specifies the dimension of each CtrlPointDbl set in CtrlPointDbls. This method expects 2D-polynomial (X,Y) or 2D-rational (X,Y,Weight) curves to be passed as trimming curves. However, you can set a flag so that this method accepts 3D-polynomial (X,Y,Z) or 3D-rational (X,Y,Z,Weight) trim curves. To do this, negate the absolute value of the first value in the VDim array. For example, if the first VDim value is 3, set it to -3. When you do this, 3D trim curves are expected.\nIf Dim is:\n2, specify (X,Y) control points in each CtrlPointDbl sub-array.\n-2, specify (X,Y,Z) control points in each CtrlPointDbl sub-array.\n3, specify (X,Y,Weight) control points in each CtrlPointDbl sub-array.\n-3, specify (X,Y,Z,Weight) control points in each CtrlPointDbl sub-array.\nMultiplicity of a knot is the number of times it is repeated in the knot vector. There are specific rules around number of knots, knot multiplicity, and curve order. For example, if a curve's Periodic value is:\n0 (non-periodic), there must be (NumCtrlPoints + Order) knots and the maximum multiplicity of any knot is Order.\n1 (periodic), there must be (NumCtrlPoints + 1) knots and the maximum multiplicity of any knot is Order. If a knot has multiplicity greater than 1, repetitions must occur at the end of the knot vector.\nIf you do not want to specify a UV range, use null or Nothing in the UvRange array elements.\nAfter calling this method to add a trimming loop, you can generate a trimmed surface by calling\nIBody2::CreateTrimmedSurface\n. You can create a body from trimmed surfaces using\nIBody2::CreateBodyFromSurfaces\n.\nNOTE:\nIt is highly recommended that you consult other resources for the mathematics behind b-splines, knots, knot multiplicity, and control points before attempting to use this method.",
