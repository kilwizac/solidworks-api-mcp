  "remarks": "Because every assembly has at least one configuration, you can use this method to begin traversing an assembly and its components.\nThis method returns a component object that is, essentially, a launching point for your assembly traversal. It is useful only for calling\nIComponent2::GetChildren\n. Most other IComponent2 object functions do not work with this root component object and return null or Nothing or an error condition. You can call\nIComponent2::IsRoot\nto determine if you have the root component.\nAn IComponent2 object is based on the currently active configuration; one assembly configuration might suppress the component, while another might display it. Therefore, your traversal of IComponent2 objects might vary if you switch to a different configuration.\nThe order of calls used in a typical assembly traversal is:\nIModelDoc2::GetConfigurationByName\n(called only once)\nIConfiguration::GetRootComponent3 (called only once)\nIComponent2::GetChildren\n(called recursively)\nFrom the SOLIDWORKS API, the IConfiguration and IComponent2 objects provide access to all the child components, their transforms, their bodies, as seen in a specific assembly configuration. The component body objects and component transforms can vary based on the configuration; therefore, you should traverse components for each configuration. For example, one assembly configuration might include an assembly-level feature that cuts a hole through each of the components in the assembly.\nYou can use\nIComponent2::GetBody\non each assembly component to get the body of each component with the hole feature that was applied in this configuration. If you switch to a configuration without the assembly-level hole and re-traverse the component objects, then IComponent2::IGetBody returns the body object without the hole feature.\nSOLIDWORKS generates an IAssemblyDoc\nRegenNotify\nevent to indicate that a change might have taken place in one of your components. If you receive an IAssemblyDoc RegenNotify event, then you should re-traverse your components to be sure that your information is up-to-date.\nIf this method is called from the configuration of a part document, SOLIDWORKS returns null or Nothing.\nYou should use this method of assembly traversal to replace previous calls to the member class.",
