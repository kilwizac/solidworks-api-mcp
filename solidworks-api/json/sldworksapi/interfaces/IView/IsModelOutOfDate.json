  "remarks": "A model can be out-of-date in a Detached drawing where the model is not loaded, if any of the views in any of the sheets in the drawing refers to a model that has been modified and saved to disk since this drawing was last saved. This situation is flagged upon opening a document as well.\nIf you are using\nISldWorks::OpenDoc6\nwith the silent option enabled, this warning is returned via the Warnings argument by value swFileLoadWarning_ModelOutOfDate. If you print this drawing and have the swRapidDraftPrintOutOfSynchWaterMark user preference enabled (see\nISldWorks::SetUserPreferenceToggle\n), then the printout will indicate this drawing as being out-of-synch.",
