  "remarks": "Call\nISketchBlockDefinition::GetLineCount\nbefore calling this method to get the value for ArraySize.\nThe return value is the following array of doubles:\n[\nColor, Type, Line Font, Line Width, Layer ID, Layer Override, [Start], [End]\n]\nwhere all data values are returned as doubles:\nColor\n= COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default color.\nType\n= line type. Valid returns as defined in\nswLineTypes_e\n. A lineType is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight.\nLine Font\n= line style. Valid line styles as defined in\nswLineStyles_e\n.\nLine Width\n= integer value defining the line width. Valid width values as defined in\nswLineWeights_e\n.\nLayer ID\n= integer value indicating which layer holds this entity. Obtain the\nILayer\nobject by passing this integer value to\nILayerMgr::GetLayerById\nor\nILayerMgr::IGetLayerById\n.\nLayer Override\n= integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore, if LayerOverride is returned as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer.\nStart[3]\n= array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the line start point.\nEnd[3]\n= array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the line end point.\nThis set of data repeats for each line in the sketch. The number of doubles returned is (lineCount * 12). To determine the number of lines in the sketch, use\nISketch::GetLineCount2\n.",
