  "remarks": "This method creates a spline in the active 2D sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch is created. Use\nISketchManager::ActiveSketch\nto check if the sketch active.\nThe PointData array is a set of, at least, two X, Y, Z values. The X value for the start point of the spline is PointData[0], the Y value for the start point is PointData[1], and the Z value for the start point is PointData[2]. The X value for the next point is PointData[3], and so on.\nThis method does not work with\nISketchManager::AddToDB\nor\nISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded\n. It always adds the spline directly to the database (as if ISketchManager::AddToDB(True) was in effect), and you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added (as if ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded(False) was in effect).\nIn 2D sketches, SOLIDWORKS ignores the Z value in PointData.",
