  "remarks": "The sketch entities appear on the screen after performing\nIModelView::GraphicsRedraw\nor\nIModelView::IGraphicsRedraw\nor\nIModelDoc2::EditRebuild3\nis performed. Also,\nISketchManager::AddToDB\nmust be true to use this method's settings.\nThis display setting remains even after your program run has ended. Therefore, it is recommended that you reset this parameter to TRUE at the end of your program. For example, if you have ended your program and the display is set to FALSE, then the user would have difficulty performing selections and newly created entities would not be seen until a redraw or a rebuild.\nNOTES:\nIModelView::GraphicsRedraw and IModelView::IGraphicsRedraw are much faster than IModelDoc2::EditRebuild3.\nISketchManager::AddToDB and ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded also increase performance during sketch entity creation.",
