  "remarks": "This method allows you to create:\n2D splines.\nOn-surface splines as can also be created using\nTools > Sketch Entities > Spline on Surface\n.\nTo create a 2D spline, specify:\nPointData with at least six coordinates (for the start and end points of the spline):\n[\nstart_pt_x, start_pt_y, start_pt_z, end_pt_x, end_pt_y, end_pt_z\n]\nFor 2D sketches, SOLIDWORKS assumes PointData contains no Z values.\nSimulateNaturalEnds with true for zero curvature end conditions or false to maintain curvature at the ends.\nAll other parameters with null or Nothing.\nTo create an on-surface spline, specify:\nPointData with two or more points anywhere in 3D space. Each spline point will project onto a surface in the Surf array, depending on the direction vector specified for each point in the Direction array.\nSurf with an array of surfaces onto which the PointData is projected.\nDirection with an array of vectors, which are projection directions for every point in the PointData array. If Direction is Nothing or null, then the view vector for the current screen view is used to project each point onto a surface.\nFor on-surface splines only, Status contains an array of statuses, one for each point in PointArray. True indicates that the point successfully projects onto one of the surfaces. False indicates either:\nthe point does not \"hit\" any of the specified surfaces using the direction that the point is mapped to in the Direction array,\n- or -\nthe spline cannot be continued at that point where the surfaces are no longer contiguous.\nThis method:\nCreates the 2D spline in the active sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch is created. Use\nISketchManager::ActiveSketch\nto check if the sketch active.\nCreates a new 3D sketch to create the on-surface spline. Call\nISketchManager::InsertSketch\nto finalize the sketch.\nDoes not work with\nISketchManager::AddToDB\nor\nISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded\n. It always adds the spline directly to the database (as if ISketchManager::AddToDB(True) was in effect), and you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added (as if ISketchManager::DisplayWhenAdded(False) was in effect).",
