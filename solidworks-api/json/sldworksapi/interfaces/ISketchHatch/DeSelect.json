  "remarks": "This method does not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running. Use\nIModelDoc2::DeSelectByID\ninstead of using this method. IModelDoc2::DeSelectByID handles selection correctly whether or not a command is running.\nTo select or deselect a sketch hatch, the owning document of the ISketchHatch object needs to be open and visible.\nISketchHatch selections are accessible through the\nISelectionMgr\nof the owning document of the\nISketchHatch\nobject, even if the owning document is not active.\nSelection or deselection does not work for a sketch hatch in a component within an assembly. Selection or deselection does not work for a sketch hatch in a document within a drawing. Selection or deselection of sketch hatches owned by the top-level assembly or drawing works, but only if the assembly document or the drawing document is active.\nIf the owning sketch of a sketch hatch is active (inactive) when the sketch hatch is obtained, then it must be active (inactive) to deselect it. For example, if the owning sketch of a sketch hatch was active when the sketch hatch was obtained, then the owning sketch must be active to select or deselect the sketch hatch. Likewise, if the owning sketch of a sketch hatch was inactive when the sketch hatch was obtained, then the owning sketch must be inactive to select or deselect the sketch hatch.",
