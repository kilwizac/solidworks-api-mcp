  "returns": "Array with two longs or two integers (see Long vs. Integer ) identifying this sketch hatch ID (see Remarks )",
  "remarks": "The ID of the sketch hatch:\nis an ordered pair (i1, i2). The combination of these two numbers is always unique within a specific sketch.\ncannot be assigned by applications or users.\nis not the same as a\npersistent reference ID\n.\nEach entity within a specific sketch has a unique ID. However, a sketch line can have the same ID values as a sketch arc within the same sketch. Likewise, in a second sketch, you may find a different sketch element with the same ID. Therefore, your application must keep track of:\nsketch element type (that is, point, line, arc, spline, and so on)\nowning sketch name\nsketch element ID to uniquely identify a sketched item\nYou can determine the sketch element type by using\nISketchSegment::GetType\n.",
