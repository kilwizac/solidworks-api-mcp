  "remarks": "The index starts at 1, even when using C++. However, if you specify -1 for the Index argument, then the Mark argument is ignored and the dynamically highlighted view is selected if dynamic highlighting is turned on. See also IAssemblyDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, IDrawingDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, and IPartDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n.\nThe point returned from\nISelectionMgr::GetSelectionPoint2\nor ISelectionMgr::IGetSelectionPoint2 cannot lie on the object that was selected. For example, the user can select an edge when the edge is within the pick radius of their mouse cursor. However, to get a point on a face, edge, or vertex, use that object's GetClosestPointOn method.\nTo do this, get the\nIFace2\n,\nIEdge\n, or\nIVertex\nobject using the\nISelectionMgr::GetSelectedObject6\nmethod, and then use that object to call GetClosestPointOn. Pass the X,Y,Z values returned from ISelectionMgr::GetSelectionPoint2 or ISelectionMgr::IGetSelectionPoint2, and the GetClosestPointOn method will return the closest X,Y,Z point that is on the face, edge, or vertex.\nIf the selected object is sketch geometry, then the coordinates returned are in sketch space. The coordinates are 2D and related to the origin of the sketch that owns the selected geometry.",
