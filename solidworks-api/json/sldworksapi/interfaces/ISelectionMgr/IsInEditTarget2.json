  "remarks": "Calling this method is necessary in assemblies when the end-user performs in-context editing of a part. This method allows you to determine if a selected item belongs to the model that is the current edit target.\nThe index starts at 1, even when using C++. However, if you specify -1 for the Index argument, then the Mark argument is ignored and the dynamically highlighted view is selected if dynamic highlighting is turned on. See also IAssemblyDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, IDrawingDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n, and IPartDoc event\nDynamicHighlightNotify\n.",
