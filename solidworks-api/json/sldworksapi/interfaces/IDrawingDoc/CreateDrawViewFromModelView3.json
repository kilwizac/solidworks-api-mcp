If this setting is set to True, then when a new drawing view is inserted, that view automatically scales to fit nicely on the drawing sheet. If there are no views on the sheet, the sheet scale is changed to the appropriate scale, and the view created uses the sheet scale.\nIf a model document  is currently open in SOLIDWORKS and you don't know its full pathname, call\nIModelDoc2::GetPathName\nto populate ModelName. Include the\n.sldprt\nor\n.sldasm\nextension in the pathname.\nViewName must exactly match the name of the model view. For example, the names of the standard views begin with an asterisk. This asterisk is part of the view name and must be included (for example, \"*Front\").",
