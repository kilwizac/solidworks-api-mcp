  "remarks": "This method only supports importing to a drawing; it does not support importing to a part sketch.\nThe Layers argument can contain either a string or an array of strings, where the strings are the layer names with which to work. You can also specify the argument as empty, which indicates all layers. If this method is not used, the default behavior is to import all layers with the same visibility as they have in the DXF/DWG file.\nThe layer visibility is the same for all sheets that are imported; you cannot specify the layer visibility on a sheet-by-sheet basis.\nHidden layers are always imported to the drawing sheet.\nYou should first specify the behavior that applies to all layers, using an empty VARIANT, because this overrides any information you have previously entered for specific layers. Then, you should use this method with layer names in the VARIANT, to override that default behavior on a layer-by-layer basis.\nVisual Basic for Applications (VBA) Example\nTo import all layers with the same visibility as in the DXF/DWG file (this is the default behavior):\nboolstatus = ImportDxfDwgData.\nSetImportLayerVisibility\n(emptyVariant, swImportDxfDwg_LayerMaintain)\nTo import layer \"A\" hidden and the remaining layers visible:\nboolstatus = ImportDxfDwgData.\nSetImportLayerVisibility\n(emptyVariant, swImportDxfDwg_LayerVisible)\nlayerName = \"A\"\nlayerVariant = layerName\nboolstatus = ImportDxfDwgData.\nSetImportLayerVisibility\n((layerVariant), swImportDxfDwg_LayerHidden)",
