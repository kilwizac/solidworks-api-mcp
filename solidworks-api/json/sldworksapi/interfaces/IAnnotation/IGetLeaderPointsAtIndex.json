  "remarks": "The index value is 0-based. Therefore, a valid index value is greater than or equal to 0, but less than the number of leaders on this annotation.\nUse\nIAnnotation::GetLeaderCount\nto find out how many leaders are on this annotation. If the index value is invalid in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), then SOLIDWORKS returns an empty SafeArray or S_false.\nYou must determine the number of points in the leader to use the data returned by this method. The number of points is a function of the number of segments in the leader. There can be one or two segments in a leader line, depending on whether or not it is a straight, bent, or underlined leader. Use\nIAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle\nto determine the number of points in the leader.\nIf IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle returns swNO_LEADER, then the number of points = 0.\nIf IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle returns swSTRAIGHT and swUNDERLINED then the number\nof points = 2.\nIf IAnnotation::GetLeaderStyle returns swBENT, then the number of points = 3.\nAdditionally, for the COM interface, you must determine the number of points to allocate the appropriate size array for the return value. The number of points must also be passed to the method to help prevent overwrite problems if you have not allocated an array that is the correct size. If the number of points passed does not match what is found, SOLIDWORKS does not return any point information and returns S_false.\nThe format of the return array is:\nretval[0] = X-coordinate of first leader point\nretval[1] = Y-coordinate of first leader point\nretval[2] = Z-coordinate of first leader point\nretval[3] = X-coordinate of second leader point\nretval[4] = Y-coordinate of second leader point\nretval[5] = Z-coordinate of second leader point\nretval[6] = X-coordinate of third leader point\nretval[7] = Y-coordinate of third leader point\nretval[8] = Z-coordinate of third leader point\nYou cannot directly set the leader coordinate information. The leader coordinates are computed based on the annotations text and attachment points. Use\nIAnnotation::GetPosition\nand\nIAnnotation::SetPosition\nto get and set the text point.",
