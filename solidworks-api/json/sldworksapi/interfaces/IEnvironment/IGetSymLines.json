The size of the array returned by this method is based on the number of lines within this geometric tolerance symbol. You can determine this number using the return value line count from\nIEnvironment::IGetSymEdgeCounts\n.\nThe format of return value is the following array of doubles (in this example, for the\ni\nth line):\nretval[6 * i + 0] = x coordinate of first point\nretval[6 * i + 1] = y coordinate of first point\nretval[6 * i + 2] = z coordinate of first point\nretval[6 * i + 3] = x coordinate of second point\nretval[6 * i + 4] = y coordinate of second point\nretval[6 * i + 5] = z coordinate of second point",
