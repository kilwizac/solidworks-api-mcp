  "returns": "Along an axis defined by an edge or a plane Along the line-of-sight between two points",
  "remarks": "The way you define the directions of your forces depends on which forces you are creating. If you are creating an action-only force, the force direction remains fixed with respect to some part in your model, either a moving part or the ground part. In this case, you can define the force direction using one vector defined by an edge or a plane.\nIf you are creating an action/reaction force, then the direction along which you want the force applied is defined by the line between two points in your model and is constantly changing throughout the simulation. In this case, you can define the force direction as the line between the two points.",
