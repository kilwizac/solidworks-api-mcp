  "remarks": "The number of features returned by this method does\nnot include subfeatures. Subfeatures include, for example, mate features within a mategroup, drawing views on a sheet, and so on. One way to identify a subfeature is whether it can be returned by:\nIFeature::GetFirstSubFeature\nor\nIFeature::IGetFirstSubFeature\nIFeature::GetNextSubFeature\nor\nIFeature::IGetNextSubFeature\n.\nThis method returns the number of features returned when traversing the Feature list with\nIModelDoc2::FirstFeature\nor\nIModelDoc2::IFirstFeature\nand\nIFeature::GetNextFeature\nor\nIFeature::IGetNextFeature\n. This value may be useful in feature traversal or if accessing the feature by position using\nIModelDoc2::FeatureByPositionReverse\nor\nIModelDoc2::IFeatureByPositionReverse\n.",
