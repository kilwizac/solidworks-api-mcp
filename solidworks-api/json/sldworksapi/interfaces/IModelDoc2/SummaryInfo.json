However, the DRAWCLI application shipped with Visual C++ does include a sample implementation, in the form of the class CSummInfo, which you can use as an example when implementing your own. This class is used by the document class CDrawDoc. DRAWCLI also includes property pages for displaying and modifying Summary Information.\nSome dates are localized.\nOption Explicit\nSub main()\nDim swApp           As SldWorks.SldWorks\nDim swModel         As SldWorks.ModelDoc2\nDim Text1           As String\nDim Text2           As String\nDim Text3           As String\nDim Text4           As String\nSet swApp = CreateObject(\"SldWorks.Application\")\nSet swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc\n' All of these date strings will be localized according to\n' the current regional settings\n' These two dates (day, month, and year)\n' will be in numeric format and localized\nText1 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoCreateDate)\nText2 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoSaveDate)\n' These two dates will be the same as displayed in the\n'\nFile, Properties\nmenu in text format\nText3 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoCreateDate2)\nText4 = swModel.SummaryInfo(swSumInfoSaveDate2)\nDebug.Print \"CreateDate = \" + Text1\nDebug.Print \"SaveDate = \" + Text2\nDebug.Print \"CreateDate2 = \" + Text3\nDebug.Print \"SaveDate2 = \" + Text4\nEnd Sub",
