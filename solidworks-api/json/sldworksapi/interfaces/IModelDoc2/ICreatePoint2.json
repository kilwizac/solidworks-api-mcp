  "remarks": "This method creates a point in the active 2D or 3D sketch. If a sketch is not active, the point is not created and NULL is returned. Use\nIModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2\nor\nIModelDoc2::IGetActiveSketch2\nto check to see if the sketch is active.\nIModelDoc2::SetAddToDB\nand\nIModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded\nincrease performance during entity creation by adding entities directly to the SOLIDWORKS database. IModelDoc2::SetAddToDB also avoids inferencing.",
