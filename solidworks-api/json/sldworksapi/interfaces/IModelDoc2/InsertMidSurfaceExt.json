  "remarks": "A midsurface feature is calculated from the solid body in your part document. This method first finds all parallel pairs of faces from the part solid. For each pair of parallel faces found, it creates a neutral reference surface between the two faces. The placement position of the reference surface is controlled by the placement parameter. This process repeats itself until all parallel body faces are processed. At the end of this process, all the reference surfaces are sewn into a single reference surface if knitFlag is set to True.\nThe hierarchy of a midsurface feature is:\nA midsurface feature contains one or more reference surfaces. If sewn successfully using the knitFlag = True option, then the midsurface feature contains only one reference surface. Each reference surface is considered a sheet body. The sheet body has the normal topology that you would expect to find on a body object (for example, faces, edges, and so on). See the\nIMidSurface2\nobject for methods that provide access to this topology.",
