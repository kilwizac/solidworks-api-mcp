  "description": "Releases the locks that a file system places on a file when it is opened and detaches that file from the file system.",
  "signature": "System.Int32 ForceReleaseLocks()",
  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "1 if locks are released, 0 if not",
  "remarks": "This method only supports part and assembly documents; it does not support drawing documents. See\nISldWorks::CloseAndReopen\nfor details about closing and reopening a drawing document without unloading its references from memory.\nYou must call\nIModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace\nafter calling IModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks to re-attach the detached file to the file system. If you do not call IModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace after calling IModelDoc2::ForceReleaseLocks, then you will experience problems with OLE objects (e.g., design tables).\nIModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace re-attaches the detached file to the file system; however, any changes made to the detached file are not preserved unless you save the file to disk before calling IModelDoc2::ReloadOrReplace.\nCAUTION:\nThis method is intended to be used by PDM systems. Using this method incorrectly could corrupt your data.",
