  "returns": "Array of edges",
  "remarks": "The edges returned by this method are transient and should be regarded as read only. They can be used to obtain the underlying\nICurve\nobjects, but should not be used for manipulation or to obtain any other objects through them. These pointers should not be saved; if they are needed again, they should be obtained at that time.",
