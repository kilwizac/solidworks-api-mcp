  "remarks": "The list contains only those bodies associated with reference surfaces. What results is a list of bodies, which is related to the model, but it does not include the part body itself.\nA reference surface feature can consist of one or more surfaces knitted together. Each reference surface feature has two\nIBody2\nobjects:\nOne for the front faces\nOne for the back faces\nEach IBody2 object has one or more faces depending on whether the reference surface feature is a set of knitted surfaces or a single underlying surface. The corresponding faces for each body pair should have normal vectors that are opposite.",
