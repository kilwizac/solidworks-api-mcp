  "remarks": "This method returns features in the current order for the part, and this order changes when the part is edited.\nYour application should not assume that:\nfeatures retain the same relative or absolute position throughout the part\u2019s lifetime. For example, you should not assume that Sketch1 always appears before Sketch2.\nany feature has a specific name. Because features can be renamed, you cannot assume that the first reference plane feature is named Plane1.\nWhen traversing the FeatureManager design tree, your application should use\nIFeature::GetTypeName2\nand\nIFeature::GetSpecificFeature2\nto identify specific features instead of relying solely on\nIFeature::Name\n.\nThis method returns features in the model definition order, which is not the same as the order displayed in the user interface. See\nITreeControlItem\nfor details.\nIf a feature is suppressed, then this method can still access the feature.\nTo access the next feature in the FeatureManager design tree and subfeatures, use\nIFeature::GetNextFeature\nor\nIFeature::IGetNextFeature\nand\nIFeature::GetFirstSubFeature\nor\nIFeature::IGetFirstSubFeature\n.",
