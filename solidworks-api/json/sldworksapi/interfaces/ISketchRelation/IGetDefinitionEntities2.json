  "remarks": "When you create a sketch relation, an internal entity may also be created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you add a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may be created. If this happens, then\nISketchRelation::GetEntities\nand\nISketchRelation::IGetEntities\nreturn the point and sketch segment.\nTo get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call\nISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities2\nor ISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities2. For example, if the relation is of type\nswConstraintType_e\n.swConstraintType_OFFSETEDGE, and the relation is created by selecting a face, then this method returns that face.\nBecause some of the objects may be null, you should check for null before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.\nBefore calling this method, call\nISketchRelation::GetEntitiesCount\nto get the value for NumEntities.",
