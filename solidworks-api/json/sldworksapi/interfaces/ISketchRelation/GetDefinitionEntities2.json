  "returns": "Array of the actual entities for this sketch relation",
  "remarks": "When you create a sketch relation, an internal entity may be created to define that sketch relation. For example, if you add a sketch relation by specifying or selecting a point and an edge, a sketch segment may be created. If this happens, then\nISketchRelation::GetEntities\nand\nISketchRelation::IGetEntities\nreturn the point and sketch segment.\nTo get the actual entities used to define the sketch relation, call ISketchRelation::GetDefinitionEntities2 or\nISketchRelation::IGetDefinitionEntities2\n. For example, if the relation is of type\nswConstraintType_e\n.swConstraintType_OFFSETEDGE, and the relation is created by selecting a face, then this method returns that face.\nBecause some of the objects may be null, you should check for null before accessing them. You should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.",
