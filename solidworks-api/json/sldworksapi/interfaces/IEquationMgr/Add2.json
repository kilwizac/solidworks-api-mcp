  "remarks": "To add an equation using the SOLIDWORKS Design user interface, you must embed the names of dimensions and global variables in double quotes:\nGlobal variable assignment:\n\"B\" = 2\nComponent equation:\n\"N_SPOKES@CirPattern\" = \"BARLENGTH@Sketch2\" /10\nDimension equation that uses the Visual Basic IIf function:\n\"D1@Extrude2\" = (IIf(\"D1@Extrude3\">20, 15, 6))+5\nDimension equation that sets a dimension to the current value:\n\"D1@Extrude2\" =\nNOTE:\nTo add an equation using this method, you must specify Equation with the names of dimensions and global variables in double double quotes and the entire equation in double quotes. See the\nExamples\n.\nIf you call this method to add an equation whose left-hand side already exists in another equation, this method returns an error.\nSetting the Solve argument to false delays evaluation of this equation, which enhances performance when there are many equations to solve. When Solve is set to false, the equation appears in the FeatureManager design tree only after calling\nIEquationaMgr::EvaluateAll\nor\nIModelDoc2::EditRebuild3\n.\nTo add equations to models having multiple configurations created in SOLIDWORKS 2014 or later, use\nIEquationMgr::Add3\ninstead of this method.\nWhen you add an equation, you are adding it to the list of relations. Thus, do not add an equation while traversing the equations in a model, because SOLIDWORKS could crash.",
