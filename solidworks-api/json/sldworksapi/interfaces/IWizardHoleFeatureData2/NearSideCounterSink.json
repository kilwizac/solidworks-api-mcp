  "returns": "True if the near side option for the countersink Hole Wizard feature is selected, false if not (see Remarks )",
  "remarks": "If you set this property to true, you must also set\nIWizardHoleFeatureData2::NearCounterSinkDiameter\nto an appropriate value in meters and\nIWizardHoleFeatureData2::NearCounterSinkAngle\nto an appropriate value in radians to modify the Hole Wizard feature definition. If you do not set the diameter and angle to their proper values, then this method has no effect.",
