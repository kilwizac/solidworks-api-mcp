  "remarks": "This method is typically used when you are grabbing the view handle using\nIModelView::GetViewHWnd\nor\nIModelView::GetViewHWndx64\nand drawing to the view. For example, if you had a point located at 2,2,2 in model space coordinates, then you could multiply it by this return value to determine where to draw in screen space coordinates. The result will be pixel values for the current view.\nThe screen space coordinate system has its origin in the upper-left corner of the current view with the X vector pointing to the right and the Y vector pointing down.\nIf the SOLIDWORKS file is in view-only mode and is not displaying a shaded image, then you cannot perform any view rotations. In this situation, you should not call any of the view rotation APIs.\nTo determine if the file is in view-only mode and whether it is shaded or not, see\nIModelDoc2::IsOpenedViewOnly\nand\nIModelView::GetDisplayState\n.",
