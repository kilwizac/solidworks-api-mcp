  "remarks": "This method only affects the model view's display if:\nDisplay window was set up to display stereoscopically\nApplication is currently set to display stereoscopically.\nISldWorks::EnableStereoDisplay\nneeds to be called to do these things.\nThere are two stereoscopic display values this method sets.\nSettings[0] controls the magnitude of the stereoscopic effect by specifying the stereoscopic, virtual, camera separation. Appropriate values for this setting depend on the scale of the object, the distance from the virtual camera to the object center, the perspective field of view angle, and, perhaps, an adjustment factor that is available to the user.\nSettings[1] controls the asymmetry of the projection frustums, thus, adjusting the parallax balance of the stereoscopic scene. It is desirable for any stereoscopic scene to comfortably balance the use of negative parallax (elements appearing to float in front of the display surface) and positive parallax (elements appearing to reside somewhere behind the display surface). Appropriate values for this setting should be arrived at experimentally.\nIf this method is not called, the default settings will equal 0.0, resulting in identical left-eye and right-eye renderings, and no visible stereo effect, even if stereoscopic display is currently enabled.",
