  "remarks": "If your application must be x64 compatible, then use\nIModelView::GetViewDIBx64\n.\nThe image type and resolution can be controlled interactively under TIFF export options.\nIf TIFF export is set to screen, then the output from this method is based on the current screen resolution. If it's set to print, then the output is based on the DPI specified in the TIFF options dialog.\nThe memory for the image bits (DIBSECTION.dsBm.bmBits) and this structure are allocated by the SOLIDWORKS Design application and must be deleted by the caller. For more information, see the description of Bitmap structures and DIBSECTION in Microsoft Help.",
