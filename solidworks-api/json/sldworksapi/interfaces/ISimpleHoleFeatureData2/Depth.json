To get the depth of holes with other types of end conditions, you could:\nuse\nIExtrudeFeatureData2::GetDepth\nto get the length of the extrusion.\nanalyze the curves and edges of the hole to get the depth or thickness of it at a specific point.\nuse\nISimpleHoleFeatureData2::SurfaceOffset\nfor a hole with a depth that is offset from the surface.",
