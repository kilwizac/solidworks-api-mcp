  "parameters": [],
  "returns": "Current working directory with trailing backslash",
  "remarks": "The current working directory is used when opening documents containing references. If explicit search folders are not set (see\nISldWorks::SetSearchFolders\n), then the SOLIDWORKS Design application initially tries to locate file references (for example, assembly component parts) in the current working directory. Interactively, the current working directory is used by the\nFile Open\ndialog and is set when you choose the\nOpen\ndialog button.\nThe most current\nISldWorks::OpenDoc6\nmethod does not set the current working directory. Therefore, you might want to set the current working directory programmatically (see\nISldWorks::SetCurrentWorkingDirectory\n) before opening a file containing references. By doing this, your application behaves as if the file was opened interactively using the File Open dialog.\nFor more information on the search criteria used by the SOLIDWORKS Design application when loading file references, see SOLIDWORKS Design user-interface help.",
