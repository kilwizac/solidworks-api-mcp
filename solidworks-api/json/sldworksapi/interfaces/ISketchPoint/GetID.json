  "remarks": "The ID of the sketch point:\nis an ordered pair (i1, i2). For sketch points, the combination of these two numbers is always unique within a specific sketch.\ncannot be assigned by applications or users.\nis not the same as a\npersistent reference ID\n.\nEach point within a specific sketch has a unique ID. However, a point and other sketch objects can have the same ID. Likewise, in a second sketch, you may find a different sketch element with the same ID. Therefore, your application must keep track of:\nsketch element type (that is, point, line, arc, spline, and so on)\nowning sketch name\nsketch element ID to uniquely identify a sketched item",
