  "remarks": "Because many of the\nITableAnnotation\nAPIs apply to all parts of a table annotation that has been split, you might not want all of the table annotations when just one table annotation would be sufficient.\nFor example, if you change the thickness of the grid line, then changing it on one table annotation affects all splits of that table annotation. Thus, for this method, you might want to specify 1 for Count so that a single value is returned. Or, you can call\nIHoleTable::GetTableAnnotationCount\nif you want the total number of table annotations, including any splits, for this hole table feature.",
