  "remarks": "This method is the first in a set of related functions that construct a body from trimmed surfaces. Internally, this function also creates a list that SOLIDWORKS uses as a place-holder for trimming curves used to trim the surface to the desired shape.\nAny existing object created by this method is destroyed if you call this method again.",
