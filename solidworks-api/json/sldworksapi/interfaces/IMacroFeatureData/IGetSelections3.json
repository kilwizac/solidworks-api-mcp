  "remarks": "Before calling this method, call\nIMacroFeatureData::GetSelectionCount\nto determine the size of the arrays.\nWhen a macro feature is inserted in-context and an entity on a different component is selected, you may need to know that component's transform.\nIf the assembly is the active document, then you can use\nIEntity::IGetComponent2\nor\nIComponent2::Transform2\nto get the component's transform.\nHowever, if the part for the component is open for editing and a\nmacro feature is being edited\n, then you must use I\nMacroFeatureData::GetSelections3 to get the component's transform. This method returns the transform and the selection. If the selection belongs to the same part as the macro feature, then NULL is returned. See also\nMacro Features and Component Transforms\n.\nSee\nAccessing Selections that Define Features\nfor additional details on using this method.",
